  <p>
    Jeshua's invitation to us is to wake up from every illusion that we
    have ever been separated from God, and to remember the deepest truth
    of who we really are: <em>Christ</em>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>The Way of Transformation is learning to transform your
      lived experience, so that you enjoy it more and more; are attached
      to it less and less; and fear it not at
      all.</em><br/><cite>~Jeshua</cite>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>The Way of Transformation</em> lessons, and original question and
    answer sessions, are the second year of 35 monthly lessons given by Jeshua
    during the years 1995-1997. Together they outline the steps and
    practices for awakening in Christ Mind.
