# The Way of Mastery

The core teaching of [ The Way of Mastery ](/wom/detail/) was given by [ Jeshua
](/wom/jeshua/) through [ Jayem ](/wom/jayem/) over a three year period
of monthly sessions. The transcript of each session is available here
organized by year.

- [ Year One: *The Way of the Heart* ](/wom/woh/woh/)
- [ Year Two: *The Way of Transformation* ](/wom/wot/wot/)
- [ Year Three: *The Way of Knowning* ](/wom/wok/wok/)

The [ *Early Years* ](/wom/early/) are a collection of messages given before the core
teachings of The Way of Mastery.

The [ *Answers* ](/wom/questions/) to questions asked of Jeshua
throughout all the Way of Mastery messages are compiled and available
here.
