# The Way of Mastery

This book contains the official extraordinary and transformational
teachings of Jeshua ben Joseph who speaks not as a savior above us, but
as our brother and our friend to gently and lovingly guide us to
remember the Truth of our being. The 35 lessons in this book are a
pathway to forgiveness, self-love and the acceptance of the perfection
of each moment, and are designed to return the mind to holiness â€“
wholeness.

Jeshua speaks to every aspect of living in the world as
Christ. With practicality, humor and loving direction, He points the way
to the correction of every belief and perception that would keep us from
knowing our perfect union with God. The only question left to be asked
is: How much of God can you receive and then extend to the world?
