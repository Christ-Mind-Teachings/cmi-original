  <p>
    Jeshua's invitation to us is to wake up from every illusion that we
    have ever been separated from God, and to remember the deepest truth
    of who we really are: <em>Christ</em>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>The Way of the Heart</em> is that pathway that begins with a commitment to
      healing and awakening, and is founded on the premise that you are
      perfectly free at all times. And everything that is experienced has been
      by your choice. And at no time has there been any other cause.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>The Way of the Heart</em> lessons, and original question and
    answer sessions, are the first 12 of 35 monthly lessons given by Jeshua
    during the years 1995-1997. Together they outline the steps and
    practices for awakening in Christ Mind.
