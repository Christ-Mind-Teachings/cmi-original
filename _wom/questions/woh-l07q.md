*Question One:* If God wants only me to be happy and doesn’t require any
specific action of me, what does it mean to be the servant of God? Is
there a divine plan for action God would have us follow, or are the
actions given us based wholly upon our momentary self-perceptions? Do we
have to do things here in a particular way?

*Answer:* First, beloved friend, that is not one question. That is a host
of questions. I have said unto you many times that the Father asks only
that you be happy. And if, indeed, you are not asked to do anything,
what then, could it possibly mean to be a *servant of God*?

When you serve another, you act, you are in such a way that they receive
the joy of knowing that your full attention has been with them. To be a
*servant of the Father*, then, means that you have finally chosen to set
aside anything else that would distract your attention, and to place the
*fullness* of your attention, which is the fullness of your being, on the
Reality of the Love the Father would extend unto you. You serve God by
*receiving unceasingly* what God would offer to you.

Imagine going to work for someone who makes chocolate ice cream. And you
say unto your employer,

> What would you have me do?

And the employer smiles and says,

> I love this ice cream that I make so much that all you need to do is eat
> it. I will pay you very well, if you would just fulfill that function.

And you look at this one and you go,

> Well, I happen to like chocolate ice cream, too. And if that’s all I
> need to do, you can rest assured, you’re going to have the most loyal
> employee you could ever possibly imagine.

To serve God is not to work in the world in order to fulfill some
conception that the mind has conjured up about what it means to serve
God. It means only to drink so deeply that your cup is always
*overflowing*. There is no sense of lack and, therefore, no need to reach
*outside* one’s self to have the cup filled. And when your attention is so
devoted to the Reality of the Love that dwells within you, your cup does
begin to overflow. And as it overflows, it will seek its own way, that
is, like a river that has overflowed its banks will begin to cut new
grooves, will it not? And you can never tell, you could never bet on
which direction the new streams are going to go in. But it will bring
the sustenance of Life and of Love to all that it touches.

But those new streams will cease flowing if the main river ever forgets
its source. Therefore, you need do nothing but receive the Reality of
God’s Love for you. And, again, as you do that, it may seem in the
course of your life that you are asked to embrace some phenomenon that
is passing by, whether it be healing the shadow of one little blade of
grass within what you think is *your* conscious mind, as opposed to
everybody else’s conscious mind, to doing something that seems to be
involved with relationship in the world, whether it be feeding a hungry
child, bringing the nurturance to another through touch or through song,
planting a seed in the ground, delivering a piece of mail. It doesn’t
really matter.

As I’ve said many times, when you *truly understand* that you need do
nothing but receive the Love of God unceasingly, you will have become
that perfect servant. And then, if it arises that you’re going to be a
street sweeper, you will simply sweep the street. And you will not have
anything else in mind, save that your cup is overflowing. And others
will pass you by and they’ll say,

> This person is just a simple street sweeper, but I find myself wanting
> to walk this way to work, just to say hello. It seems to make my day.

And perhaps you’ll be asked to be the savior of the world. Only the
voice for ego would see a difference of being the savior of the world
and a street sweeper.

Therefore, strive not to know what you should do in the forms of this
world, but be you wholly dedicated to being in loving devotion, in order
to receive all that God would shower upon you: Love so grand that the
Mind can not even conceive of being without Love. And, indeed, your cup
will overflow.

Herein is the essence of the many questions disguised as the one.

*Question Two:* What is the difference between a twin flame and soul mate?
Please describe the importance of bringing two whole people to a
relationship and maintaining uniqueness while creating synergy.

*Answer:* It would not be appropriate to say that you can *create* synergy.
Nor would it be appropriate to say that you can *create* genuine
individuality. What you can create and cultivate is the willingness to
be wholly committed to *allowing* every last trace or obstacle to the
presence of Love to be dissolved from within you. Synergy and genuine
individuality arise from your devotion to being unceasingly open and
receptive to the Love of God. Like a flower bursts forth from a seed
well planted, both individuality and synergy in a *holy relationship*,
which is where only synergy can be found&hellip; these things arise from
the *receiving* of Love, the *allowing* of Love, the *remembrance* of that
Love.

What is the difference between what are called twin flames and soul
mates? First, the only difference is a matter of definition. The concept
of twin flame was given by a friend of mine as a way of assisting minds
to see that there is an aspect of them that is uniquely and profoundly
linked to something that is as much them as the self they think they are
is, that has become fragmented, that what was whole became apparently
fragmented, and, therefore, mind becomes imbalanced.

The idea was to create a story line in which the mind, so attuned to
seeking for fulfillment outside of itself, would, at least, begin to
desire that which symbolizes the movement into wholeness, the linking
together of the male and female energies within the consciousness. At
the risk, of course, that some minds would actually believe that to
discover and find one’s twin flame requires finding another personality
in a body. And yet, because in Reality that fragmentation has never
occurred, you need not go any further, in Truth, than your own
awareness, your own beingness, to discover that that one is still within
you. And you can not be separate from that one at all.

It may be that in the field of time, you, as a consciousness, will need
to have the experience of attracting one who seems to be in another
body, so that you can come together. But that is more the fruit of *your*
belief that you *are* the body than of some objective reality. For in
Reality, the Truth is one. Separation does not exist. Period.

And for soul mates? Same story. It can be appropriate to use those terms
to describe to some minds what they’re experiencing, as a way of giving
and understanding that allows them to relax and get on with it. It is
also true that within the drama of the dream of separation, there are
souls — fragments of awareness, if you will — that have danced together
and played together and have never lost the sense of union or love with,
and for, one another. And therefore, over a period of *time* and the
creation of *specialness*, those seeming two souls spark something within
one another. They recognize the Truth in the core of the other, because
they never really lost it, as they may have successfully lost it in
other relationships. And, therefore, it is . . . hmm-m . . . it
occasionally happens when two such that are on the path of awakening
require coming back together, in space and time, to spark, to re-spark
the commitment necessary to heal the sense of separation and to awaken
from the delusion that a separate self has ever existed.

This means that you are not in need of *anyone* to be whole. It also means
that when you discover that wholeness within yourself, you will be free,
if you wish, to enter into relationship with anyone you might choose,
and who would choose you. Hopefully, it will come from a place of
holiness and freedom, and not fear and specialness. For the latter leads
to pain that must yet be healed. The former leads to ongoing creativity
and enjoyment.

It is only when two who are whole come together, having looked within
and *truly understood* that *there is no lack* and, therefore, *no need*, that
the power of creativity can flow through that entity. And any such
committed relationship creates another entity, and gives birth to that
which reflects the Truth, so that it can be seen by others who abide in
space and time.

Do not attach *specialness* to the concept of twin flame or soul mate. If
anything, remember that your *soul mate* is your Creator. Everybody else
is your *friend*.

*Question Three:* How can we bring to light unconscious blocks that keep us from
manifesting our heart’s desire?

*Answer:* The answer is not as difficult as it may seem, for these blocks
are merely various forms of the *decision against peace*. Therefore, look
well and notice how you *truly feel* in any given moment, not necessarily
what you’re telling yourself. Is peace present? If it is, and something
seems to be coming into your attention, you may rest assured that the
Holy Spirit is asking you to bring the Light of Love to something that
requires healing — without asking you to identify it as your own. We
spoke of that the other evening.

You can not bring to Light what needs to be healed, since you do not
know what healing truly is. Learn to know what true healing is, and what
requires healing will present itself to you. And *true healing* is the
*decision for peace* — not the denial of *feeling*. For peace is like an
ocean that embraces all waves that may appear. One simple thing is all
you need do:

> Am I truly at peace in this moment?

If the answer is no, you need only ask,

> What is in need of healing that peace might be restored?

It will not be hidden from you. Willing to put that into practice?

*Response*: Absolutely!

*Jeshua*: Now when you make such a statement, there are those of us who
say,

> Oh, well! I’ll bring you some of my “case load.”

When there were stories written about me that said I *took on* the sins of
the world, and when you hear of masters or teachers who transmute the
sins of their students, just think of that as “karmic case loads.” And
when one says unto us,

> I’m willing to do all of this. I’m going to put this into practice —
> absolutely!

Ah, well! We’ve found a possible “employee.” You’ll never be given more
than you are capable of transmuting. And, of course, you can always quit
and look for another line of work!

Does the answer make sense to you?

*Response*: Yes, it does. Thank you.

*Jeshua*: Thank you for asking. It signals the desire for the answer.

*Question Four:* What is the interplay between playing out strong attachments,
habits, compulsions, addictions, in order to let them go with gentleness
and understanding, or using discipline and self control to end these
attachments?

*Answer:* Discipline is not a rigidity or resistance *against*. Genuine
discipline is merely a product, if you will, of the Mind. *Genuine
discipline* requires only that you bring your attention to precisely what
is true in any given moment of your experience, without judgment.
Discipline is the vigilance of awareness and the decision to *be* the
presence of Love.

The answer seems simple and short and to the point, but if you will
contemplate it, even if you will sit in your meditation and write the
answer out slowly, so that you watch the letters of the words appear on
your plain white paper, and as you give yourself permission to be
patient, not in a hurry, more will be revealed to you. And yet, the
essence has, indeed, been given. Enjoy the discipline of contemplating
the answer.

*Question Five:* There are two religious movements dear to me that I’ve seen
growing over the past twenty years. These are the Christian Pentecostal
and the New Age. How have you been an influence in their growth and
development, and how do you feel about them now? If you had the
opportunity to address these groups, what message would you desire to
communicate to them?

*Answer:* First, I’ve been instrumental because I subsidize their
marketing. [Laughter] And you laugh, but I mean that quite literally.
Hmm! There were many, there are many even in this room that would say,

> Those are two movements dear to your heart that seem rather wide apart.

And this is important because the form is always secondary. The healing
of the separation from God, melting into genuine forgiveness, the
willingness to merely let Love live where once there was a little tiny
gnat, insisting on its own ideas — this is what matters. In this way,
then, a pathway that genuinely seems to carry one to the recognition of
the Truth and, therefore, sets them free, is equal to any other path,
regardless of the “external decorations” that come with such paths.
Indeed, beloved friend, enjoy what you do of each of these paths.
Appreciate them. And walk on.

If I were to assemble everyone that represents each of the groups you’ve
recognized and stated, what would I say unto them? The same thing:

Only Love is Real.

God is but Love.

You are God’s Creation. Therefore, *your Reality is Love*.

Now go and live from your Self, that your Self might give Love to this
world.

Don’t look ahead to tomorrow. For the time spoken of is *now* for any mind
that decides that this is so.

Look not for a savior to come from the clouds. For I am with you always.
And I dwell within your heart, where, in fact, you dwell as well,
hanging out in your living room as friends having a cup of tea.

I would say unto each of them:

See not difference in one another, but see merely the distinctiveness of
a pathway through Life, in which Love can be remembered and lived.

And if that would not be sufficient for them, I would suggest that they
seek yet another path.
