## Question One

<div markdown="1" class="well">

*Question*: <span class="person">How does Jeshua explain his acts of
Crucifixion and Resurrection in relationship to us, and what is the
symbolism that he intended?</span>

</div>

*Answer*: Indeed unto you, beloved brother, this is a question that has been asked of me
many times and I would confess that there was a time when I asked these questions
of myself!

First, precious friend, when you speak of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, you
are referring first to an activity that did in fact occur in time. Let no one make a mistake
about that. Rest assured that as a man, like any other man, as a human being like
any other human being, I walked my path to remembrance of my union with God.
I learned along that path that ultimately I could give nothing to anyone without first
receiving it for myself. I became what you might call Divinely selfish­ :  that is, I utilized
the body, the mind, the emotions and every experience and every opportunity to
teach myself to choose only with the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit taught me that
death is unreal — period.

How then could I know that? How then could I bring it into the depth and core of
my being? By allowing certain environmental pressures, you might think of them — 
political pressures going on in the time-frame in which I lived — to become not my
enemies but my servants. I made a decision in the depth of my prayer and meditation
to allow myself to enter into a drama, into an arena that took place in Jerusalem.
I allowed myself to be given over into the hands of those that would become my
persecutors. I allowed myself the experience of being helplessly imprisoned by those
who were governed by fear and not by Love. But rest assured, I was governed by Love
and not fear, although it did arise one final time, when I separated myself from my
friends, and they separated themselves from me by falling asleep. And in the middle of
the night I indeed cried out my last cry of anguish,

> Father, take this from me. I think I’ve made a slight mistake
> here&hellip; > Nevertheless, not my will but Thine.

Now, with that last surrender, I walked through my final ring of fear and allowed events
to unfold as those that were in charge of those events wanted them to unfold. I used
even those moments to look lovingly upon my persecutors, to use time constructively,
to see beyond the superficialities, to see the loveliness and the Christ within them and
quite frankly, as I did that — even as I was stripped and whipped and beaten, as the
body seemed to grow weaker and weaker, as they placed a crown of thorns upon my
head; and yes, I felt the pangs of pain at a physical level, what you would call pain,
without fear of that pain — still I focused all of my attention on seeing the face of
Christ in my persecutors. And as I did that, it illuminated or refined for me, it took
me to the end of my journey. In retraining my own consciousness to see only God’s
creation, I became one with that Power, one with that Truth without fluctuation or
variance. As the events of what you would call the Crucifixion unfolded, rest assured,
all anyone was watching was what their physical eyes were showing them. Because the
masses believed the body is real, because they were identified with it, they actually
believed that I was dying, that I was suffering, that I was being taken from them. But
this pain and this anguish can come only from the delusion of believing that what is
unreal is real.

Now, in time there was in fact what is called a Resurrection. There have been many,
many stories about this; it’s not quite as fanciful as some would make it out to be. It
means simply that because my consciousness, through this final lesson to myself, had
become thoroughly settled or centered in the recognition only of the real world, there
came a point when the body, or the dust of the ground, merely lying there upon
what you would call a sheet, upon a small platform within a certain cavern or cave
(given unto me, by the way, by my uncle Joseph of Arimathea ; I just wanted to get
that in for you) — now there was a time, then, when there was simply no need for
even that dead physical form to abide. It began to dissolve, quicken its — what do you
call this? — decomposition, if you will, and literally returned to what you would call a
molecular or atomic state, a place of almost pure energy and certainly not to be seen
by the physical eyes, but trust me it was still there. Specks of dust, you might call it,
but much, much smaller.

Now, when certain friends of mine came to the tomb and found that it was empty,
they marveled. Why? Because deeply embedded in their beingness was the belief
that the body is real and that consciousness is secondary. Rest assured, it’s just the
opposite. Now, I chose to reactivate or recreate the form of the body for very specific
purposes. If you wish to communicate with someone and they do not understand
that a telephone is available, you must go to their house, take them by the shoulder
and speak into their ear. If even your best friends have not yet quite learned to
believe that they can communicate with any mind at any time, I therefore had need
of recreating the telephone of the body, to demonstrate: Look! I am alive, death is
unreal, I’ve learned the final lesson! Touch me, hear me, feel me just as you did before
the Crucifixion — and yet rest assured, I will again leave you because if I do not, the
Comforter, the Holy Spirit cannot come to guide you into Truth. But the day will
come when you will finally relinquish your need to believe in the world the physical
eyes show you. I will come yet again to speak to you from the real world and assist
you in moving into that place within yourself. I know not yet the day and the hour,
but I will come when you choose it. Beloved brother, because you hear these words
now, you have chosen, and I have come.

So, that’s the historical essence of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. What did it
mean? I have already shared that with you. It was my path of learning. I chose it, it was
not forced upon me. For my Father’s will is the same as for you: that I simply abide
awake in Him. It was my simple and particular path for learning that. Rest assured,
this should cause celebration, for it is not necessary for you to be nailed to a cross!
And why?

I have said many times that everything in your world is a symbol. Ask what the symbol
is and it will reveal the truth, it will guide you to the real world. Therefore as you
look upon the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, understand that it symbolizes the
willingness to allow a death within your consciousness of what you choose to be
identified with. If you choose identification with love and unlimitedness and freedom
and perfect peace — with the real world — then the events that unfold, even as you
experience them, lose their power to enchant you with delusion.

Contemplate that deeply. When you’ve retrained the mind to teach and choose only
Love, and to look lovingly and perhaps laughingly upon the events that pass through
you, even the body’s arising and passing away, the day will come when you can enter
into any experience in perfect peace. And when you enter any experience in peace,
you will transcend it. When you enter an experience in fear, you lock yourself into it.
That is called the creation of hell and the need for rebirth. Any experience that you
wholeheartedly choose to enter from a place of perfect peace is transcended.

Let then there be the Crucifixion of all of your false ideas of yourself. Be willing
to take the leap off the cliff, to entertain what seems to be absurd and insane and
outrageous and arrogant, according to the world. Dare to claim that you are as God
created you to be and nothing in this world holds a candle to your radiance. And long
after the world seeks to destroy you — and it’s always trying to do that — and long after
the body has been laid down by whatever means you may choose, you will remain
and you will laugh at the thought of loss and death.

This is the Resurrection then, the resurrection within your consciousness of the truth
that sets you free. See in my earthly experience only a symbol of what can occur within
you, as you choose to give your thoughts, to give your perceptions, to give your fears,
to give your petty wants and needs over to your persecutors — for you’ll believe that
the angels who have come to dismantle your illusions are your persecutors, because
death feels like persecution. Give yourself over to it. Let the mind be corrected. Let
the heart open and be healed. Let crucifixion be finished that resurrection might be
experienced. And when that Resurrection called awakening has occurred, you will
ascend to the Father, for He will take the final step for you and you will abide in the
real world.

Thank you for asking the question.

## Question Two

<div markdown="1" class="well">
*Question*: <span class="person">How do I know when I have surrendered myself to the Holy Spirit?</span>
</div>

*Answer*: Indeed, beloved friend, you will know that you have surrendered yourself
to the Holy Spirit because you will hear a loud bell go off, there’ll be much confetti
tossed by those in buildings above you! Hmm. Hmm. And someone will rush up to
you with a microphone and say, “You are the winner!”

[Laughter]

And you can stand upon the stage and say,

> I’d like to thank my mother and my father.

Hm. Beloved friend, I approach your question with levity, for levity is something
that you fear. You allow the seriousness of the intellect to interfere with the feeling
of receiving the Love of God, like a gentle peace descending upon the cells of your
being. So, there’s always a point to my seeming madness.

Now, there are indeed signs that you will come to recognize. At first they’re slippery
because you’re used to recognizing something else and calling it the real world. You
will know that you have surrendered to the Holy Spirit, first in a brief moment here
and then another moment there, but you’ll begin to feel and sense a certain quality.
That quality is peace, no anxiety felt throughout the cellular structures of the body, no
longing, no sense of loss and no dread, just the simplicity of witnessing and allowing
what unfolds as your experience in any given moment — and it is totally acceptable to
you, no matter what is occurring. That seems like madness to the world, for the world
says, “Well you’re on the right track when you know what’s happening is taking you
where you know you need to be, where success is coming to you, where comfort and
safety in the world is coming to you.”

> Ah, then I must be on the right track!

No. You’re on the right track when you know that from the crown of the head to
the tips of the toes, you are at peace with yourself and the world around you. And as
you look out upon the world in that circumstance, you see no one to blame, no one
to fear, you see only innocence. It is a palpable feeling because, you see, you believe
you’re a body and that’s how you judge things. Therefore as you learn to feel peace
through your physical beingness, as you notice that the throat relaxes when you speak,
there’s no anxiety or hurrying up of your words where someone could be ranting and
raving and you just allow them to do so, while you are undisturbed. Rest assured, part
of your mind has relinquished you to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Holy, because
it’s whole and not fragmented. Spirit, because it is the real world, not the unreal world
that you have made.

You will know, beloved brother, when you have surrendered wholly to the Holy Spirit,
when the thought of wanting to surrender no longer arises, when the recognition
dawns that there’s no longer an energy of seeking within you, when no longer do you
experience fear arising in your being, when you notice its absence and realize it’s not
been there for a very long time. You will know that you have become One, through
your surrender to the Voice for God.

## Question Three

<div markdown="1" class="well">
*Question*: <span class="person">What role does Jeshua want me to play in the bringing of Heaven to Earth?</span>
</div>

*Answer*: I want you to sell the tickets! [Laughter] Hmm. Might as well create some
profit for yourself here! Hmm.

Again, beloved brother, levity — for as you ask the question, it comes from a certain
pattern of heaviness that there is something you must look to outside of yourself, that
you must subordinate yourself to something you should do. That is a pattern of the
world’s thinking,

> Well, I have to go off to work today. Well, I should get out of bed.
> After all, it’s what’s expected.

The world mind is constantly looking outside of itself, for an employer, for a boss, for
God, for a priest, for a lover, for a child, for whatever. Some in their drunken stupor
would look for a lightpost to give them direction of what they should and shouldn’t
do. Hmm!

And yet I say unto you, beloved friend, listen well: you need do nothing save to choose
to open and receive the Love of God, to allow the mind to be corrected so that
wherever you are, you know you are Home, you are at peace, you and your Father
are One. Then, as the Holy Spirit weaves the tapestry of the Atonement, since you
will probably find that your body is still existing, there may be some requests made.
They will be simple and you are always free to accept them or reject them. What
really matters is that you choose to become the Peace of God and allow that peace
to pervade your being. That is what influences the vibrational frequencies of other
minds, even if you never lift a physical finger. Compare not your path or your life
with others, merely teach only Love. And seek first the Kingdom before all things of
the world by reminding yourself daily:

> I and my Father are One! I need do nothing and I remain as I am created to be! This world
> is harmless and already it is being translated into reality. And the Holy Spirit doesn’t even
> need me to accomplish it!

Therefore be happy in each day, trust what the heart says to you each day, allow
yourself to touch joy each day — and be at peace. And for you especially, tell yourself
a joke or two!

## Question Four

<div markdown="1" class="well">
*Question*: <span class="person">Is Christ different from Joshua or Jeshua?</span>
</div>

*Answer:* This is a very worthwhile question. As you know, an entire religion has been
built up on the exclusive identification of Christ with me — that is me as the historical
Jeshua ben Joseph, or Joshua if you prefer. Use any name you wish, it doesn’t matter
to me.

Now, Christ is God’s creation. Jeshua is a name given to a particular manifestation
of humanity called a man in physical form, a name that separates him for utilitarian
purposes from other men with different names, and women too. Christ is pervasive
and eternal. Christ is the depth of your own beingness. Imagine it to be like an infinite
ocean from which have arisen all waves that you call individual persons, whether male
or female. Jeshua, or Joshua or Jesus, that name signifies one of those waves.

Christ signifies that which pervades equally the depth and reality of all minds and
hearts. It is really more an energy, a quality of beingness. It is the literal reflection or
extension of the presence of the unlimited Love of God. Christ is God’s Son, being
neither male nor female, it means merely the offspring of, that which wells up out
of. Jeshua or Joshua or Jesus became one with Christ, identified no longer as a man
but as Christ. That passageway is the same one that everyone walks, since it is merely
the return to right-mindedness. If you see yourself only as the wave upon the infinite
ocean, that’s a start; but eventually the goal is to shift your sense of identity, so that
my words become yours:

> I and my Father are One. Not of myself do I do these things, but my
> Father does them through me. In other words, there is nobody here but my
> Father.

Christ and Jeshua are different at one level. They become one and the same as the
mind or the individual that I was surrendered the illusory perception of myself as
separate from God and became identified with only the Mind of Christ. Then, there
is only Christ and the man has disappeared, except as a temporary symbol, an anchor,
a roadmap, a direction that you can follow until you pass me by and become that
ocean yourself. And when you no longer need me in any way, shape or form, then
we will be together without interruption for all of eternity. Hm. That should give you
something to chew on.

---

## Question Five

<div markdown="1" class="well">
*Question*: <span class="person">Please say more about non-physical reality.</span>
</div>

*Answer*: More about non-physical reality.

[Laughter]

Have I accomplished the task? [chuckles]

Beloved friend and sister, what on earth ever gave you the thought — literally what on
earth ever gave you the thought — that physicality was real? If you ask me to speak of
non-physical realities, you’re already assuming that your physical experience is quite
real. How do you know that? Because somebody’s taught you it? Because you bang
into a wall and therefore convince yourself that it must be real? Does this not also
occur in dreams? When someone plunges a knife into your heart in your dream, do
not you feel the dread and terror of death, of being attacked? Until suddenly you open
your eyes and it may take you a while to shake it out of your cells but you realize: that
was just a dream. Sure seemed real to me!

In the very same way, physicality seems real — until you begin to allow correction
to come to your mind, to think the insane thought that maybe you are Christ
incarnate. As the real world comes to be re-established through your awareness and
consciousness, even while the body seems to abide and exist, you will sense it to be
very limited. Just as you may enjoy the experiences of your dream state, but when you
awaken you often feel that they were limited, there was something arising from inside
of you. As you awaken to the real world, you begin to perceive and feel the body
and physicality as something that is smaller than you that has arisen from within your
vastness, in other words that you are much more than the body can contain.

It is therefore very appropriate not to think that you live within the body but that the
body lives within you, it arises from within you, you contain it as a temporary teaching
and learning device. Love it, embrace it, have a great time with it, but don’t identify
yourself with it. Don’t limit your understanding of yourself to what transpires between
the crown of the head and the tips of the toes and when you extend your arm out,
don’t you think for a moment that you stop at the end of your finger! You are pure
energy, pure light, and your radiance shines through many dimensions and you are
linked to them all continually.

Non-physical ‘realities’ — there are many of them, if you wish to look at it that
way, and in fact the greater aspect of your beingness is non-physical. Your physical
experience is like a drop in the ocean. Let that sink in. It is like a dot on a page and
the whole while the vastness of your being is moving merrily along, experiencing
dimension after dimension. And often this will creep into your awareness in your
dreams or in your meditations: it will slip through the cracks and you’ll have what’s
called an ecstatic experience. You’ll feel like you opened, when in fact you simply
allowed the openness to seep into the smallness of your physical experience.

How then to struggle to attain experience in non-physical realms? By not struggling,
by beginning by acknowledging that you are pure Spirit, that all worlds have arisen
from within one Holy Mind, the only creation of God. You are that vast ocean and
you have merely focused all of your attention on the physical experience you are
creating. You can do that joyfully or you can look at it as some kind of a dread disease.
It’s your choice. Nevertheless, to experience non-physical realities, merely loosen
your fixation of attention on the body-mind and its experiences and problems and all
of the rest, and allow yourself to entertain thoughts of your grandeur and greatness.
Rest into — through allowing — rest into the feeling of infinity. The mind, or your
place of awareness, will begin to open bit by bit and more, more and more until you
can no longer squeeze your attention into the space and volume of a body.

This doesn’t mean you’re going to step on it like a bug and get rid of it! It means
you’ll just embrace it as another aspect of yourself, like the ocean embraces each and
every wave, allows it its experience but doesn’t cling to it and doesn’t try to make it
last; doesn’t try to make a wave become rigid as though if it failed to do so, nobody
will ever see the ocean. It allows the wave to rise, and then it passes away. The ocean
delights in it, but the ocean itself is never identified with any particular wave.

That will do for now, because in what has been shared, as it is contemplated, beloved
friend, you will find that correction is coming to certain ideas you have taken upon
yourself about what non-physical realities must be and be like, and what must occur
for you to experience them.

And again, ‘tis a good question to have asked.

No more questions.

We will end then by saying: That’s what you think! [Laughter] There will indeed be
many questions and we will begin a process then in which some of this time is allotted
to addressing the questions which come from this family.

Therefore in closing, know simply this: there can be no such thing as closure to the
extension of Love. Be you all therefore that which you are this one day, don’t worry
about tomorrow, there is no such thing. This day, walk upon your earth while making
a choice to delight in perceiving yourself as awake and alive and at peace, roaming
through a countryside called the physical dimension for a very brief time. Enjoy it,
look lovingly upon it and bless it with the blessings that can come only from the Mind
of Christ within you.

Peace then be unto you always.

Amen.
