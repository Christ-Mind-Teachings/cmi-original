*Question One:* I would like to hear Jeshua address the following issue
brought to my attention by one who does not embrace our path or beliefs.
This person quotes, “The message from Jeshua tends to privatize
spirituality and right action. One could easily forget or rationalize
away one’s responsibility to the poor and oppressed.”

*Answer:* Indeed, beloved friend, it is with great joy that we come forth
in this hour to address this specific question. For indeed, it is a
question that has been brought forth by many, many minds in many epochs.
For, you see, there is a tendency for the human mind to separate
spirituality into two camps.

There have always been those that sought to *separate* themselves from
culture, from community, from daily life, and to run off to their caves
and their monasteries, in order to seek a purely interior relationship
with God. Now, there’s nothing wrong with creating a purely interior
relationship with God, since that is the Truth of your fundamental
Reality.

However, when the mind holds the perception that it must separate itself
from what it perceives the world to be in order to discover God, that
mind is already beginning its search on a faulty premise. For this means
that one is still a victim of the world, and that the world holds a
power to separate you from awareness of Love’s presence.

Now, in the other camp, there are those who would wish to believe that
genuine spirituality means constantly being engaged in finding someone
to help or to fix. But this, itself, is also but an expression of egoic
consciousness.

> If only I can do for others, then I will validate my worthiness — not
> just to myself, not just to God, but my neighbors will see all the grand
> works that I do. So let me, indeed, rush about to feed the hungry and
> clothe the naked and house the cold. And, of course, whenever I gather
> with my friends at a cocktail party, I’ll let them know what I’ve been
> doing all week.

Each approach is founded in egoism. Now, in the latter camp, there are
those who would seek to render service to others and perceive
spirituality to require *sacrifice* of time, of energy, of money — it
doesn’t matter as long as the idea of *sacrifice* is, shall we say,
fulfilled. I want to share with you that none of these approaches is
genuinely what could be called *spirituality*.

Anyone — *anyone* — who has ever come into contact with what I teach, not just
through this, my beloved brother, but through any of the other numbers of
channels or friends through whom I am communicating with your world ... if
anyone would but read *A Course in Miracles* ... if anyone would but read the
sentences printed in red in their Holy Bibles (some of those are actually
genuinely what I taught), would be hard-pressed to overlook the most
fundamental of teachings that I’ve offered.

First, the greatest of gifts, the highest form of service that you can
give to anyone is to *assume responsibility* for your underlying sense of
separation from God and to *rectify* that mistaken perception. That is
where spirituality *must* start. For, until that is accomplished, all of
your doing in the world will be *clouded* with *egoism*. Those who strive
for peace would do well to first become established in true peace within
themselves.

Those that seek to serve the hungry would do well to nourish
themselves until they are filled, not with that which satisfies the
body, but with that which satisfies the soul. For only when the soul is
brought back into perfect alignment with its established unity with God
can the Wisdom of God inform that soul, that person, in which actions
truly serve the highest good. Without it, one will merely use ideas
learned from the world and will try to be the *maker* and the *doer* of its
service.

This is based on the assumption that one knows what their brother and
sister needs. Therefore, if you see one who is hungry and sitting on the
side of the street, saying,

> Here, give me a few shekels of coins so that I can go and eat,

...if you perceived spirituality as being a *duty* to the oppressed, the
poor, and the hungry, you would immediately look about to see what you
can do for that person, based on their request. And, more importantly,
based on what *you perceive* is amiss.

But how do you know that there is something amiss because a soul has
chosen to create a situation in which they have no job, no home and no
friends? Remember always that each mind literally creates its lived
experience in this domain. There is no such thing as victimization. And
oppression does not come from without. Oppression is a perception
created within that mind. Anyone who looks upon the history of humanity
can recognize many instances in so-called oppressive situations where
individuals have simply chosen not to be oppressed, and have moved with
freedom and with dignity, even into what appears to be death.

Therefore, beloved friend, understand this well: Relationship is the
means to your salvation. But the fundamental relationship that must be
rectified, must be nourished, must be healed, must be cultivated, is
your *direct* and *immediate union* with, and *communication* with, your
Creator. When this is established, the soul rests in perfect peace. It
has far transcended the impulse to be the doer and the maker. It looks
out upon a world completely forgiven; in your language, “let off the
hook.”

One does not look out and see a world that must be saved. One no longer
looks out and sees a world in travail. One merely becomes the servant of
the extension of Love and makes no pretense that it knows beforehand
what that should look like. But in every moment and with every breath,
that mind merely asks within,

> Father, what would you have me do this day? How might I be of service as
> your plan for the Atonement is achieved in human consciousness?

One learns to listen to that Inner Voice that might very well say,

> I want you to establish hospices in every city in the world. Begin now.

That same Voice might say to you,

> Go and sit by the park this day and forget the world. Breathe deeply of
> the Angel of Air. Let the Angels of Sound of the Running Waters fill
> your soul and heal your bodies. Nourish yourself today. Go watch a
> movie, play with your friends, read a good book, have a cup of tea.

Those that believe spirituality rests on how much service is given to
the oppressed might never hear the Voice that says,

> Include yourself in the circle of your Love.

Therefore, awakening requires that all vestiges of the world mind are
cast aside and one rests in that Perfect Truth which can *in*form perfect
action, *right action*, through you. Again, the fulcrum of what I am
sharing rests on this: Without the interiorization process of
cultivating the healing of your misperception that you’ve ever been
separate from God, without cultivating deep Self-love — not love of ego,
but love of Self — without that, the deep silence required wherein one
hears the Voice of the Comforter is never achieved. And only that voice,
the right-mindedness within you, can perfectly *in*form your actions in
the world.

Therefore, he who follows me, indeed, journeys to the desert for forty
days and forty nights, and leaves his friends and disciples and
businesses and associates to go off and be alone for prayer, for
cultivating daily the process of seeking first the Kingdom ... that
all things, including how you can be of service, might be added unto
you. Think not for yourself, but love the Self enough to surrender the
world into God’s hands. And see it not as a place that needs you to fix
it. For, of yourself, you can do nothing. "I am the vine and you are the
branches." Remember always that, without the Christ Mind dwelling within
you, that of yourself, you can do nothing. And your service, though
laudable in the eyes of the world, means nothing.

*Question Two:* I understand that the path of the poor and oppressed is their
path. However, when and how will they understand, comprehend, that they
are not victims? And how can they, too, participate in embracing
ascension? Do we have a responsibility to bring the message, help them
spiritually and physically to throw off the bonds? I feel a need to
share the Love. How is this to be done?

*Answer:* Beloved friend, when you look upon one who you would perceive as
poor, hungry or oppressed, first *pause* and look within yourself. What
part of *you* is feeling poor? What part of you perceives yourself as
hungry? Where within your own being do you feel oppressed? And then take
steps is to rectify these perceptions by healing your life of their
energies. When you look, then, upon another again, always cultivate
first the ability to see the very essence of their soul. For they are
pure consciousness, pure divinity. They are like a sunbeam to the sun,
yet given perfect free will choice. Their journey has been as long as
yours and as varied. Therefore, when you look upon them, see them in,
and held by, the Light of God.

Why is this important? It is not just mental gymnastics. For, as you see
another, you will see yourself. And as you see yourself, so, too, will
your brother come to see you. If you wish to help another be lifted up
out of their misperception that suffering is a requirement, then be you,
therefore, *committed* to being the *embodiment* of one who has awakened to
the *Truth* and *lives it*, who *breathes* it, who *acts* it, who *thinks* it, who
*talks* it without ceasing!

Now, when will they come, those that you perceive to be oppressed? And
rest assured, in any given moment, when you look upon who’s sitting by
the wall on the sidewalk with a little tin cup, saying,

> I need some money,

you need only go within and ask the Holy Spirit,

> Is it appropriate, now, for me to render any form of service to this, my
> brother or sister?

The answer will not be hidden from you.

Again, that returns us to the point of not thinking for yourself. But
turning all decision over to the one Teacher and Guide given unto you,
the bridge between the Love of the Father and the place of your soul:
the Holy Spirit. When will they arise from their slumber? Beloved
friend, when did *you* arise from *yours*? You may not remember that hour
and that day, but there was a moment from within your consciousness — it
may not even have been in this incarnation — when something *changed*, and
a decision was made not to accept limitation, not to accept the pain and
the guilt of perceiving yourself as separate from the Source of your
creation.

Therefore, know well that not you, *no one*, not even I, can force another
to arise. And no one can do it *for* another. You can, of course, listen
to the Comforter’s guidance, so that Love is extended through you
appropriately in each and every moment. And then, release yourself from
being attached to that extension, whatever it may be — whether it be a
golden coin, or a meal, or a new Mercedes. It doesn’t matter. It might
be just a gentle smile. For as you choose to extend Love, by first
abiding in the Reality that you are the *presence* of Love, having been
made in God’s image, you provide for your brother or sister the
*opportunity* to recognize the presence of Love and *decide anew* for him or
herself.

And if you’re guided to feed them, then prepare them a meal. Let them
eat it, but be not attached to the fruit of that meal. See their
essence, love them, and live *your life* in fulfillment. Far too many seek
to assist others when all it does is truly *oppress* them, because it does
not empower them to take responsibility for the choices that they have
made and the effects that have come from them.

Do not just give money indiscriminately to those that say,

> Oh, I’m broke. Do you have an extra $5?

Go within and ask,

> Am I just in my neediness to be a helper and a fixer? Can I surrender
> this and just ask Holy Spirit, “What would you have me do or say? I am
> completely unattached to my need to be of service.”

When will they arise and know ascension? When they decide to, just like
you did. And how can you extend Love? Beloved friend, *by giving that
Love first to yourself*. For, if you are not fed deeply, you cannot feed
another. Therefore, lay up for yourselves treasures which are in Heaven.
That is, cultivate higher consciousness. *Cleanse* and *purify* your
communication device, the body. Make it as *radiant* and as *beautiful* and
as *healthy* as you wish it to be. Create abundance in your own life. Feel
rich and wealthy in God’s Love, so that your cup can organically and
naturally *overflow*.

If there are two that are hungry, it is wise that one arise and learn to
feed himself. Then the Holy Spirit can use your gifts, use your power,
to assist in *genuine service* to others.

*Question Three:* Jeshua, how does one teach a young child peace and Love when
they’re acting out their fear and anger?

*Answer:* Beloved friend, this could, indeed, be a whole year’s tape
series in itself. However, for the sake of this hour, we would say this
unto you: Remember well that when you perceive a child acting out their
anger, their fear, whatever it may be, first, ask yourself: Are you sure
it’s *theirs*, just because it is being expressed where their body seems
to be? For be of assuredness, that children come into this world
sparkling clean. They are very clear — *very clear* and *very, very
sensitive*. Therefore, if there are emotions that the parents are not
dealing with within themselves, if there is lack of communication
between the parents, if there is anger that has been repressed in the
mother or the father, then indeed, *the child will know it*, and often
will begin to unconsciously act it out, since nobody else is bothering
to, shall we say, “clear the decks” and be honest. Therefore first ask
yourself: How do you know it’s their anger? Ask the Holy Spirit,

> What is the source of this?

The answer will not be hidden.

Now, how to help them? Where you perceive anger in another, first make
sure that *you* are clear of anger within yourself. Then, as you look upon
the child, remember that that child is *perfectly free now*. Ask of
yourself: Does their anger, their acting out, push your buttons? Can you
give them the space and the freedom to act out that anger, to move that
energy in a way that is healthful and helpful? Can you allow them to do
so? And convey to them that,

> This looks like fun! Maybe I’ll join you!

And start to move your body the way they’re moving their body. Make the
sounds that they are making. And tell them straight out like an adult.
Stop talking gibberish to children, for they are as old as you are the
moment they are born. Tell them in perfectly clear adult language,

> Anger is perfectly okay. Let’s get into it and see how it feels in the
> body.

Have fun with it. Make it as charged as possible. And you will find
that, in a very short moment, the anger will shift, and the children
will begin to feel a sense of play. For they will know that they have
been *accepted*, and that there is nothing wrong with them the way that
they are. Just because they don’t conform to adult perceptions does not
make them wrong.

How, then, do you teach them of peace? By being peace yourself. How,
then, do you teach them to cultivate peace? By not hiding from them your
own emotions, by living honestly — not hurtfully, but honestly.

> Yes, I’m feeling angry right now! It makes my stomach tight and my
> shoulders crinkle up into my ears. It makes my knuckles get white. And I
> just want to stamp my feet!

Well, *do it* right there in front of the child! And, as *you* start to feel
better, you can smile and say,

> See how easy it is? I think I’ll just be at peace now.

Therefore, always remember that the greatest of gifts you can give to a
child is to be the living embodiment and model of one who does not deny
or repress their humanity.

Beloved friend, each relationship is a teaching and learning
relationship. Therefore, when a child seems to be acting out their
anger, first give them the space to do it, and *observe* the child. How do
they move their body? Do they just live in their head? Or is their whole
being involved in it? What can you learn from the child?

And when the anger has subsided, *always, always, always* wrap your arms
around them, at least metaphorically. Let them know that you love them.
Let them know they’re okay. Let them know that yes you too know that
sometimes it’s a little hard to be in the world and that you thank them
for being present in your life, because you are committed to learning
*from them* as much as you are committed to *teaching them.*

Cease — everyone that could hear these words upon your planet — *cease
treating children like second class, incapable people*. *Their
consciousness is clear and bright!* Talk to them like an adult. Live like
a mature adult in your relationships with them. Give this a try, beloved
friend. There is much here for you, if you will but cultivate the
treasure within these words.
