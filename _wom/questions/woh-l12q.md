<!-- Track q1 -->

*Question One:* On the day of your crucifixion, it was told that you spoke the
words, “Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?”

Can you elaborate on that? Will you?

*Answer:* That is always the proper question. First, I have, indeed, given
forth this answer to a certain one that you’re aware of. We would highly
suggest that you merely obtain that answer, for it was not given to be
kept and held in privacy. Now, we would amend it by saying that I’ve
felt guilty about that statement ever since. [Laughter]

Beloved friend, if I have not touched every kernel of humanity and the
experience of it that you have known, it is useless for you to listen to
me. And I have nothing to offer you. Therefore, to have come into your
world and to have, shall we say, made myself impervious to doubt, pain,
guilt, tears, anger, you name it — yes, even lust — to have done that
would have rendered my relationship with you *meaningless*.

That is what we’ll give as an amendment, a clarification, a driving home
a very important point that can then be amended or added to the answer
that you will extract, that has already been given. Does that make sense
for you?

It is a very good question, but in the end, bring it around a little
further and ask of *yourself*,

> Why have I said, “Father, why have you forsaken me?”

Something to be pondered.

*Question Two:* There seem to be many, many women who tap into memories and
experiences of being Mary Magdalene. Can you talk about that, or the
fragmentation of that one soul?

*Answer:* Beloved friend, we would suggest here there are many in what you
call the male body that also hold secretly that very same thing, a
little more deeply, because they would perceive that it would truly be
seen or perceived as insanity.

> Well, since I only have this kind of apparatus ...

what you call the plumbing and that which helps to — in the procreation
process of the body,

> since it is of a certain type, surely I could not possibly have ever
> known incarnation in any other kind of form. So, if I say to another “I
> believe I’ve tapped into being — having been — Mary, the one that you
> speak of,” but then I would certainly be laughed at. Because, after all,
> my chest has too much hair on it. But no, I don’t believe I’m just the
> body!

[Laughter]

Now, what occurs? In the beginning, Mind is One. You — we speak to all
"yous" — were That Mind. A dream was dreamt in which fragmentation seems
to have occurred. In that fragmentation, it is as though many individual
Points of Light, Souls, Sparks of Divinity, call yourself whatever you
want, call yourself a Burp in the Mind of God ... it doesn’t matter.
That is the *result* of the dream of separation, which, in Reality, never
occurred.

It does rather boggle the mind — thank God for that! In that process,
many worlds have been birthed, and continue to be birthed, by Mind as It
perceives Itself as fragmented. In one tiny, tiny, tiny speck of dust or
speck of Light, a world was birthed that you call the Earth, and all
life forms with it. And in that tiny speck, a time frame was evolved or
created in which human bodies were given names. And minds believe
themselves to be, much as you still do yet today, that you are somehow
something other than the one who sits apart or across from you, just
because there’s a body that creates the perception that there’s a
distance from you.

One such very temporary illusory fragmentation is That One known as Mary
of Magdalene, Mary of Magdala. Within that dream, one emerged known as
Jeshua ben Joseph. And in the process of that expression of that dream,
these two, shall we say, looked upon each other and went,

> Oh, my goodness! How sweet it is!

That is, as souls, as yet still parts of that dream — it’s not that
we’re from someplace higher than you. We’re all in it together, since
Mind is One.

In that dream, there was relationship, 2,000 years ago in embodied form,
between two Sparks of the same Mind, manifesting as individualized
consciousness. One is called Jeshua, one is called Mary. And a rather
nice friendship evolved in which one seemed to serve as the teacher and
the savior, and the healer of the other, who then, in turn, served as
supporter, healer and awakener of the other.

Now here’s the point: That individualized focus of Light lives within
*everyone*. How could it be other than that? Just as I, as an
individualized aspect of the dream, *abide wholly in everyone*. You, again
speaking to all of you, could not begin to recognize me as Jeshua ben
Joseph, that individualized Spark of Divinity that somehow got its
“stuff” cleared up enough to remember the Truth and let it shine
through -- you could not know me or remember me, if I was not you. It
takes *One* to recognize *One*.

So when you approach the question of Mary Magdalene from the perspective
that there is something separate from yourself to begin with, you’ll end
up with all kinds of fantastic perceptions and philosophies. Now, within
the dream, That One, who’s really you, experienced a process of healing
and awakening, a transformation, a healing of the heart, experienced
relationship with me and many others, experienced passion and sensuality
— what you call the little sparks that excite the cells. When This One
died — and death is an illusion — that crystallized contraction of
energy has, in itself, never incarnated again.

However, it has — in a sense, you could perceive it this way — extended
or radiated aspects or strands of Light of its own being that have made
a home in other individualized body-minds. And therefore, in the process
of healing and awakening, This One needs to be looked upon as a *symbol*
of an aspect of the part of consciousness that is awakening within
yourself — that part that can recognize and love Christ and take Christ
into its arms, *your* arms, and embrace it as the *Beloved*.

It is time to release the insane perception that there is a separate
you, distinct from all other "yous", that has incarnated over and over
again. We talk this way because a teacher must have a form of language
that the student can understand. But the point is to lead *beyond* that
language and understanding, to release the attachment and the value that
has been placed on an *individualized past*. And to anyone who feels that
they *must* have been Mary: You’re not special. Do not make the egoic
mistake of claiming That One as yourself, in order to feel *special* or
*closer* to God.

Your value is not found in the past. It is not found in who you *were*,
but in who you are choosing to be *now*. And if your name is Fred or Ralph
or Hazel, it doesn’t matter. For Hazel can be just as Christed as Mary
ever was. And indeed, Hazel *must* become Christed in order to be free.

It is the egoic mind that looks to the *past*. It is the egoic mind that
*requires specialness*. It is the egoic mind that simply refuses to let
you, so to speak, settle in to be Hazel, or Fred, or George, or
Anastasia. These are merely sounds floating in the ethers that designate
a temporary aspect of Christ’s incarnation. So you’re beginning to see,
then, why there can be so many "Marys." Some are sincerely tapping into
that aspect of the One Mind. Some need to create the illusion that they
were That One because they refuse to heal the holes in their bucket
where they are, and seek to reach back and find that energy in another
and make it their own. It is called *special relationship*.

Look well, then, and see:

> Is there anything lingering in me which needs to reach out to grab
> another part of myself in some ancient past so that I can finally feel I
> have some measure of worthiness?

The only thing that defines your worthiness is how well you are choosing
to be the embodiment of Christed Consciousness *now*.

This is why I once taught, and continue to teach, that belief in
reincarnation is not necessary for awakening. And if you think it is,
you may rest assured that, if there’s anything unhealed from the past,
it is with you now. Learn to look only to how you are *now*. For there you
will discover the effects of what was not healed in what you perceive to
be the past.

You need not go to the great Akashic Record Library and research
yourself on the cosmic microfiche of the world in order to discover who
you *were*, so that you will understand why you’re such a schmuck now.

[Laughter]

> There, I finally got it! Whew! Ah, that explains everything.

As you down yet another beer. You are creating your schmuckness nowhere
but right now. So, will you be the princess of schmuckdom? Or will you
don the cloak of one who assumes complete responsibility for creating
their experience?

To those that seem to feel an affection for the "Johns", and the "Marys",
and the "Peters", the "Judases", notice that it’s coming up in your
consciousness so that you can make the decision to love that expression
of the dream and see the Christedness that is its essence. Bring it into
yourself. Love it. Let it go. Let it be assimilated to that which you
are.

Therefore, for all of you, then, to contemplate, especially if you’re
feeling some affection or attraction or identification with this Mary,
why not stop keeping Her at arm’s length and, in your meditation, ask
yourself,

> What are the qualities of That One that make me feel so affectionate
> toward Her? What is it in Her that I desire to have within myself?

And bring those qualities in. Again, as though you were a sponge. Make
them part of your being. Overcome the fragmentation that has occurred in
the dream of separation. Does that make sense for you?

Now, I know that what I’ve just shared might give a few a bit of a start
when they hear these words. If it does, it only means that they’re yet
needing to perceive themselves as having some *special* form of
relationship that somehow got lost in an ancient past. No. It is not
lost. And they must take another step and realize that they have to
start doing the work, if that is what it is perceived to be, of getting
on with what has not been completed here and now.

> Am I embodying Christed Consciousness?

Yes or no.

> What steps do I need to take to do that?

That’s all there ever is.

That should suffice for now. The only other alternative, of course, is
to remain in the kingdom of schmuckness.

<!-- Track q3 -->

*Question Three:* You had mentioned you’re coming through 2,003, or so, other
people. And there have been several people out there claiming to have
channeled St. Germain. And we have been told by Jonah that nobody does
channel St. Germain. They only receive thought forms. So the question
is: Are there people out there who are authentically channeling our
mutual friend, St. Germain?

*Answer:* You’re asking what is called a technological, philosophical
question. You are doing what is called the “mincing of words.” It is the
*effect* that matters.

We would suggest here for you that This One, my friend who was once my —
almost my — executioner . . . that, indeed, is symbolic for you. For who
do *you* perceive as your *executioner*? That One communicates with many.
For That One has long since learned to assume responsibility for those
assigned to Him. That One does communicate through thought forms to a
*multitude* of beings. That One, by the way, still pops in and manifests a
body whenever He wishes — just to spend a few moments on a park bench
with an old friend. This One lives in complete unlimitedness.

Therefore, to the degree that those minds receiving This One’s thought
forms are continually at work keeping their garden well-cultivated and
free of egoism do, indeed, reflect very accurately that which This One
would seek to transmit. As you would understand that which you are
calling channeling, in which This One’s consciousness blends with the
temporarily-crystallized form that you call a certain individual, in
order to speak through the mind, the mental field, the language
structure of that one to others, This One, my friend, does indeed do
that, from time to time. But as you would perceive it, the number of
those through whom that effective blending is occurring is very, very
small. We would say that you could count the number as less than the
fingers on two hands.

But there are a multitude who receive This One’s thought forms, and a
multitude who do a very, very good job of transmitting those thought
pictures, those images, those thoughts, into a language that conveys His
message to those in your world. Does that help you in that regard?

*Response*: Much.

*Jeshua*: Always what matters is this: Anyone who serves as what your
world is now referring to as a *channel* has the very same work in front
of them, constantly, that anyone does — the work of constant
self-cultivation, surrender, allowing, trusting, letting go, letting go
of egoic consciousness, letting go of need for specialness, staying in
observation of how one is truly being. Surrendering, surrendering,
surrendering.

> I’m not the maker and the doer.

I’m not the one who knows anything.

I need nothing from anyone.

Who do I need to let off the hook?

How deeply can I master forgiveness?

And all of the rest. That is primary. And, in fact, the relationship,
such as the one between my beloved brother and myself, is one that
accentuates the need for that one to practice these things.

We would also say here that it is possible, and Germain is one of these
who can overcome the impediments within the consciousness of another to
get their thought form well planted, well received. So it’s kind of a
mutual thing. The channel must always be involved in the same work that
everyone’s involved in, because *everyone is a channel*. And nothing is
manifested through them, save the frequencies that they are allowing to
make a home in their mind ... those that channel my beloved friend, as
you would call Him, as St. Germain ... although, where we abide,
sometimes we joke about the “saint” part of that. Now, those that are
channeling Him, then, are no different than you. They need to keep doing
their own inner work. Their goal should not be to rest, but to
continually desire to be the embodiment of Christ Itself. Not to rest on
their laurels, so to speak.

At the same time, rest assured that we are capable of ensuring that the
purity of that vibration be maintained. Because, when it isn’t, we
simply pull away. If egoic consciousness begins to take root in any
channel, we simply, shall we say, “put it on a shelf” and wait until
later. And it is only *you* who can discern whether what is being spoken
is flowing from us or is merely the repetition of a record that has
already been implanted in that one. Then they’ve reached a certain limit
of their own growth and we have departed. And you are well aware of
that. It is a vibration that you sense, even in the cellular structure
of the body.

Does that help you in regard to that question?

*Response*: Yes. Thank you.

*Jeshua*: Indeed. So have you any other questions?

*Response*: No.

*Jeshua*: Rest assured, unto you we would say that, in the weeks to come,
a multitude of questions you did not know exist will come into the
surface of the consciousness.

*Response*: I’m sure.

*Jeshua*: For only one reason: so that you can embrace them with the
answers that you already know. And, thereby, be freed of the past.

*Response*: Amen.

*Jeshua*: Very well then, as you have spoken: Amen.
