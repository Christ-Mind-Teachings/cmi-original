## Question One

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yes, Jeshua, thank you.

It&rsquo;s the first time in feeling the sense of wonder that
you&rsquo;re inviting me and us into, that I&rsquo;m approaching&mdash;I
usually experience goals and desires as kind of burdensome, but
it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;m feeling a certain goal that I really
like is something that I can approach in the spirit of fun. And I
don&rsquo;t even really know what my question is, but I know
that&rsquo;s what I want to talk to you about.
</div> 

Now, listen well to what you&rsquo;ve just said, and contemplate what was said a moment
ago to you. There was a reason for it.

If you would indeed draw to yourself the clarity of a certain answer, make sure that
you ask a clear question. Therefore, allow yourself, beloved friend, to just relax for a
moment. It does not come from the mind, it comes into the mind from a relaxed state
of being, a relaxed emotional body. Merely begin within yourself to say,

> What question would clearly attract to me the answer that I seek to discover?

So we will pause, while you allow the question to be birthed.

[Pause]

You almost had it.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
How can I discern Love&rsquo;s questions from fear&rsquo;s questions?
</div> 

It is actually very simple. Love&rsquo;s questions literally create within the physical body a
sense of joy. It may be subtle. A sense of excitement, a sense of wonder, a sense of
well-being, a sense of expansion. You can learn to discern the quality of this feeling
in the cellular structure of the body itself. Fear&rsquo;s questions create exactly the opposite:
a loss of aliveness, a sense of foreboding, a contraction, a coldness, a darkness. A very
good practice, then, for you as well as for many (and luckily your question can serve
more than just yourself)&hellip;

As you sit in your meditation and allow questions to come, as you begin to become
disciplined in your awareness that you&rsquo;re watching what&rsquo;s going on in the mind from
moment to moment, when questions come up in your mind, pause and look at it,
and ask yourself,

> Is this a question from Love or from fear?

And then ask yourself,

> What do I notice in my beingness that is associated with the arising of the question? Is it a
> feeling of fun and wonder, a bit of an excitement, a sense of expansion? Or is it a contraction,
> a coldness, a foreboding, a dissonance instead of a resonance?

Does that make sense for you?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yes, it does.
</div> 

It would be very good for you to practice with that. For you see, everything is a matter
of vibration. Thought is a frequency of energy. God&rsquo;s thoughts are the highest form of
energy&mdash;Love unimpeded, meeting no obstacles. Love is a state in which fear cannot
be present.

Therefore, look well and learn now to feel the quality of energy that you are abiding
in, as different questions arise in your mind. You will come to see very, very clearly
that the qualities of energy revolving around and emanating from questions being
birthed through and in the vibration of Love are completely and totally different from
the feeling and vibratory quality of the questions arising in and around the energy of
fear. In fact, they are as far from one another as the East from the West, and have
literally no similarities. One specific quality that comes from questions of Love is a
feeling of relaxation, so there is not a sense of urgency and impatience. Hmm. Just a
thought to think about, to wonder about.

Beloved friend, because you have chosen to take the time to allow the clear
formulation of the question, now that &lsquo;unseen something&rsquo; can begin to direct a much
clearer answer to you. And the clarity of the answer is what moves you from who you
are toward what you wish to be. And, of course, what you&rsquo;re wishing to be is who
you really are.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yes
</div> 

Indeed.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Thank you, Jeshua.
</div> 

Do you know why this work occurs? Because I was willing to ask a clear question
of myself when I was a man who walked upon this plane and saw the incredible
limitations of physical form, and dared to think new thoughts. How could I possibly
find a way to communicate with all minds in all dimensions of creation? What
would I have to become? How would I need to change in order to experience
unlimited communication? The answer was the process of crucifixion, resurrection,
ascension, Christed Consciousness. So the answer taught me, because it became my
experience&mdash;all based on the desire of finding an answer to a clearly asked question.

Where there are no questions, you already have your answer. And how many in your
world never ask new questions, and then wonder why nothing changes?

---

## Question Two

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
The question is how to develop a greater clarity and discernment around wearing one&rsquo;s own emotional
body and energy and staying clear with that and not, so to speak, take on the cloak or clothes of
another&rsquo;s emotional body and wearing theirs?
</div> 

Beloved friend, imagine that you are sitting in a grand orchestra and there are many
violins and many flutes and many oboes and many clarinets, and what have you, that
comprise this orchestra. And the show has not yet started and so everyone is tuning
up their instruments. And as you sit there (you are a flute player) you place the
mouthpiece in the instrument, and as you raise it to your lips you&rsquo;re a little nervous
because, after all, this is a new show for you, you&rsquo;re the rookie on the block, so to
speak. And you seem distracted by the sound of the oboe, the sound of the clarinet,
the beating of the drum, the little squeal of the strings of the violin. For a moment you
are distracted. Which sound is my sound? How can I hear my own sound if all these
other things are making noise around me?

The virtuoso, so to speak, the master of the instrument, learns to put their attention on
what they want rather than on what they fear is preventing what they want. And what
you want to do is hear the sound of your own flute. And so you bring your instrument
to your lip, and you begin to blow across it, until you find just the right angle so you
can begin to emit the note.

> Oh, that&rsquo;s the one I like. Oop, now I&rsquo;m being distracted by the oboe again. Rather than
> thinking, how can I separate myself from the oboe, focus only on what do I want to hear?
> My own flute.

Practice blowing the note again. By turning the attention to what you want, by
releasing the oboe players and the violinists and all of the rest from being blamed for
distracting you. Focus on what you want. What is the frequency you want to feel in
your body, what are the thoughts you want to think? Put your attention on generating
the momentum of blowing the note that you want to hear in yourself. And as you
build that momentum, it begins to sound like the note struck from a crystal glass:
shining radiantly, sounding radiantly through empty space, where nothing obstructs it.
So that even that the oboe player and the violinists are doing their thing, you are so
absorbed, you focus all of your attention and all of your desire on not worrying about
what they&rsquo;re doing, or how their sounds may be affecting you&mdash;but when you feel
the effect or distraction of the oboe, you turn again to creating the sound of what you
want. Whether it means breathing deeply, whether it means smiling lovingly, whether
it means thinking a thought that &ldquo;It is done and I acknowledge it.&rdquo; You learn to turn
the attention of your mind in the direction of what you want to feel and to experience,
to call into your reality. That is what builds the strength.

And, you see, that is what brings the answer to the question. For, as you begin to
stabilize&mdash;by focusing on what you want&mdash;you become familiar with the frequency of
the note that you are creating as the flute player. And the more familiar you become
with that note, the clearer it becomes what is not that note.

And in just the same way, whenever you think you&rsquo;re feeling energies and you&rsquo;re not
sure whether it&rsquo;s yours or somebody else&rsquo;s, turn the attention of the mind from that
thought&mdash;that&rsquo;s a useless question. Bring it back to the focus of:

> Who cares what I&rsquo;m feeling now or what I think might be going on. What do I want? Oh,
> I want my body to be relaxed. I want to look lovingly upon the world that I see. I want to
> walk as a Christed being in feminine form. I want to be happy. Well, what would that feel
> like in this moment? Ah.

Begin to use the power of creation, that you&rsquo;re always using, to create differently&mdash;by
bringing the attention from worrying about the oboe player to focus on the radiant
jewel that you can bring into being by blowing your own note. Strengthen that.
Become it.

If you were to go to a gymnasium to exercise a muscle, and you go to lift the weight,
you would not allow yourself to look around and wonder who&rsquo;s lifting what weight,
and why can&rsquo;t I lift that weight over there, and all of those other things. You would
know that you&rsquo;re only there to focus on what you are doing. How are you moving
your muscles? How are you lifting that weight? What does it feel like within you? For
you know that if you distract yourself, you might hurt yourself. Is that not true?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Uh-huh.
</div> 

Each time you choose to let yourself be distracted by what others are doing, by
dissipating your attention away from the note you want to learn to play, and that comes
by asking the question:

> What would it be like to be perfectly at peace in this moment?

> What would it be like to be Christ incarnate?

> What would it be like to be with no fear?

> What would it be like to be free of my past histories?

By focusing on your note, you discover that the only time you ever harmed yourself
is when you put your attention on trying to figure out what was somebody else&rsquo;s, and
what are they doing? The more you focus your attention here on blowing the perfect
note through your flute, all of this around you will begin to fall away. It is called, I
believe, vigilance and discipline.

[ Laughter. ]

Let me give you a picture.

Imagine being a Jew, the son of Jewish parents, middle class to lower middle class,
as you might call it, in a cultural time frame of great upheaval: great fear and doubt
and struggle and conflict. Imagine standing in a circle, what you might call a plaza, I
suppose, in an ancient city called Jerusalem. And seeing the bedlam all around you,
and suddenly realizing that none of it matters. The only thing that matters is what do
I want? I could have made the choice and said I want to be a successful merchant,
or a successful money changer, like everybody else. But, instead, I decided to go for
the gusto and ask the impossible thought, the improbable thought, the heresy, the
heretical thought: What would it be like to be Christ incarnate in the midst of this
place? I turned my attention to focusing on asking what I truly wanted. And that has
made all the difference.

Would you be willing, then, to begin to discipline the mind, to bring it back to asking
yourself that question:

> What is it I truly want? What would it be like right now, to become so outrageous in the
> midst of what I think is an insane situation, to choose to be unlimited and perfect peace?

Any such thought like that will do, as long as it&rsquo;s highly unlimited.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Okay.
</div> 

Does that help you in that regard?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Uh-huh, very much.
</div> 

So then we&rsquo;ll be seeing if you decide to play the flute well. Beloved friend, you might
as well, you&rsquo;ve already explored the vagaries of the clarinet and the oboe and the
trombone.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Don&rsquo;t forget the drums!
</div> 

And the drums.

## Question Three

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Jeshua, what is like to live the Christ vibration in 3-D?
</div> 

It&rsquo;s a lot of fun. It is the wonder of wonders. It is so sublime and so grand that no
words can contain it. It is to be in the world but not of the world. It is to be so filled
with wisdom and compassion and love and power and capability, and at the same time
to know that you are literally nothing. Of myself, I do nothing. And many sought to
make me their god. And, yet, I was telling them, don&rsquo;t look at me. I&rsquo;m not the maker
and the doer. I am the witness of grand mystery that I now allow to flow through
me. And each so-called miracle was a miracle unto me. It brought a freshness in each
moment, to step with a foot upon the warm earth at mid day, and to be in total awe
that that experience could arise, that by placing one foot in front of the other, I could
end up at a well having a conversation with a woman that changed her life, that the
holy spirit could speak through me to wonder how I even arrived at the well in the
first place. It wasn&rsquo;t my intention. It was only my intention to be in a state of awe and
wonder and allowing.

To be Christ in the third dimension is a very unique experience. It lasts only the
twinkling of an eye, but that&rsquo;s how long the body lasts. But while it lasts, I can tell
you this, nothing you can imagine or ever create, nothing any mind has ever pondered
can match the sublime fullness and fulfillment that comes as the result of asking the
question you have asked. For each question must be answered. And the answer is
always the experience of the fulfillment of the question. Continue, then, to ask that
question.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
There&rsquo;s one that goes with it for me, and that is, if being the Christ vibration in 3-D is as sublime as
you just described, then being co-creating Christ in 3-D must be a blast. And I wonder if that&rsquo;s ever
happened in the 3-D history that we&rsquo;ve known of before?
</div> 

The answer is no. It has never occurred upon this plane. There have been many
grand civilizations, but each, no matter how far removed and even beyond the one
you know, as we stated earlier, by comparison yours is extremely primitive in relation
to some that have existed. But in each one of them, the thought was held that some
could be Christ, but not everyone. They just held that perception that there had to be
this hierarchy. Does that make sense to you?

Therefore, the thought that is penetrating or descending is the thought of a world
in which all body minds manifest the fullness of the Christed consciousness. Second
coming, indeed. No, it has never occurred, but it will.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
So that&rsquo;s one of the real opportunities we have in Shanti Christo.
</div> 

It is not just one of the opportunities, it is the only opportunity. Everything serves that,
or can serve it. Everything grows out of whether or not there will be minds willing to
ask that question with you and be committed to receiving, which means to become,
the answer. For my two cents, if I had cents, I would say there could be no grander
adventure than the field of time. Does that help you in regard to the question?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yes, thanks.
</div> 

Oh. Then the answer is already being received.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
What an adventure. I feel like I&rsquo;m waking up in the conversation we&rsquo;re having.
</div> 

Ah. Wonder of wonders. Hmm.

---

## Question Four

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
The question has arisen about the Shanti Christo membership, and the
comment was that it was &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo; to have tapes only go to
members. And the question is&mdash;what is the question? For those not
able to manifest the means to become a member right now, whether the
Shanti Christo play in that role to open up and extend tapes to those?
What&rsquo;s your view on that?
</div> 

Not able to manifest the means?! Beloved friend, well have you asked the question
for it states a universality in human consciousness to deny the simple truth of all that
we&rsquo;ve said in this hour: There is never a time that any soul is limited; it chooses to manifest
and experience exactly what it&rsquo;s experiencing.

No one has a dollar bill in their pocket unless they have chosen that experience. There
is absolutely no one who is without power to manifest the means of manifestation if
they are willing to take responsibility for their miscreations. And they smile and say,

> Well, if I created that, I can start anew.

Exclusivity is the most interesting word in your language. Listen well. When one
views something as being exclusive, they have literally chosen to place themselves on
the outside of what they see as being exclusive. It is not the thing in itself, whether
it be an organization, a group, a relationship. That is not what causes exclusivity.
Perception creates experience&mdash;always, always, always. And if anyone would view
anything and judge it as being exclusive, then there is an opportunity for them to stop
and see how they literally created the feeling of being excluded. Does that make sense
for you?

Free will choice is never taken away. I have never excluded anyone from me, and yet
many, many, many have judged my work, both at the time I walked upon this earth,
as being highly exclusive. Why did you only selected those disciples? Why are there
more women than men? I didn&rsquo;t choose them. They chose themselves. The same is
true now. Does that help you in that regard?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Uh-huh, yes.
</div> 

Now. You have an interesting phenomenon in your culture where there are many
clubs that are created. Men have clubs and exclude women. Women have clubs and
exclude men. Whites have clubs and exclude blacks. Blacks have clubs and exclude
whites, and reds, and everything else on the planet. Yet I say this unto you: all that
matters is what do you truly want. If you look upon anything occurring in your
society and see it as some form of exclusivity, stop and look and check your own
energy. You are feeling excluded from something, and that is why you have called to
yourself the experience that reflects the quality of exclusivity. There is something you
are excluding yourself from in your own consciousness. It may not be that club: that
is a symbol of the energy that is going on within your beingness. Therefore, if one
says, well, this is exclusive, the wise student pauses, reminds themself that what they
experience, they have created. And if they are seeing exclusivity, they need to begin
to ask the clear question: what am I excluding from myself? How am I shutting up
energies of exclusion? Does that make sense to you?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yes.
</div> 

So are there any more questions? [Pause]

So to each and every one of you that has heard these words, remember that it is a
stepping stone. Begin to look at each and every one of your days and all of your
experiences, as you being the literal and only creator of your experience. And it can
be anything that you want. God doesn&rsquo;t care. You see, God is content to create you.
What you do with the power that She has given unto you is your business. But part
of God&rsquo;s creation is to extend complete freedom to his creations. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to
God because He knows that you&rsquo;re going to come home, when you choose to. And
your throne awaits you: the throne of mastery over your creations.

We begin then, now, to weave a blending that will create a vibration and frequency
through this &lsquo;family&rsquo;. Hmm. A family which is limited because we&rsquo;re excluding others!
[Laughs] It is an open invitation. And any are free to join in the dance, if they have
heard truthfully the desire to awaken within themselves.

In closing, then, in this hour, my peace do I give unto you&mdash;and not as the world
gives, give I unto you. Why would I want to give as the world gives? Surely that is
the height of insanity. For the world gives only to take away. The world gives only
that you might recognize the world and its greatness. But I give as my Father once
gave to me&mdash;freely, unconditionally, as the overflow of love.

Therefore, peace be unto you always, creators of heavens and hells, who are free at
any time to choose anew. And because I am without time, I can wait forever for you
to choose with me.

Amen.
