Question and Answer {#QA09}

## <span class="tr_hide">Question One</span> {#l01q1}

<!-- Track q1 -->

*Question One*: How do you know if you are truly being guided?

*Answer*: Indeed, beloved friend, this is a question of great importance,
though think not that *importance* requires *seriousness*. Therefore,
understand that as you seek to separate yourself from the roar and the
din of the world, from the world mind, from the opinions of those around
you, and seek to shift the momentum of the mind back toward the heart,
toward the Kingdom of Heaven within you, toward that silence in which
the Voice of the Comforter speaks, know well that the very first step is
to *begin at the end*. By this we mean *always*--and never, ever fail to do
this--*always* begin any such period of meditation or prayer by
acknowledging the Truth that is true always, that transcends the
shadows, the illusions, the misperceptions of the world. And that Truth
is simply this: You cannot be less than what God has created you to be.
Separation from God does not exist. And if you find that you exist in
this moment, it can only be because you are, indeed, one with that
Creative Source that has birthed you in It’s own image and has given you
access to all wisdom and all Truth and all support. For you are, indeed,
loved above all things.

Therefore, begin always by acknowledging that this is the Truth. Then,
allow the body to relax. And as it does so, look with the inner eye, the
mind’s eye, at the situation, the context that seems to be presenting
itself to you--whether it be of relationship, career, what have you.
Simply, then, look with the mind’s eye upon the context and say,

> This context has no power to harm me. It comes because I have called it
> in my own desire to grow in wisdom, to grow in strength and power and
> certainty.

Then, remind yourself that only the Comforter’s guidance, the inner
Voice of the Holy Spirit, can think *rightly* for you. Ask of That One,

> My Friend, what is this context for? What lesson do I need to learn?
> What decision truly will carry me in the direction of my deepest
> commitment?

And I emphasize the word *commitment* here, for as you well know, and we
have spoken many times, that until the mind, until the soul, until the
heart becomes fully committed to awakening from every last trace of
illusion, until it becomes fully committed to bringing forth the gifts
that have been placed within it by God, life is like a ship without a
rudder. Therefore, ask what that decision is that *truly serves* the
commitment that you have made to awakening to the Mind of Christ, to
being the embodiment of wisdom and of Love and of peace.

Now having done that, remember that--at least in the initial stages of
the journey--the egoic mind will always speak first. In other words,
you have *learned* to look to the *world’s thinking* to find the solutions
to the contexts, or what you call problems that present themselves.
There is a period of *retraining* the mind in which you become more and
more detached from the thinking patterns of the world. But when you
begin to enter silence in this way, and ask,

> What decision truly serves my highest good, my deepest commitment?

the first voice that you will usually hear is that little voice that
says,

> Oh, no. Don’t do that. No, no. Don’t do this. This will not leave you
> safe. And what about this person? And what about that person? And what
> about all of those things?

If you are observant, you will notice that when that voice speaks, it
creates a restlessness within the body-mind itself, like an ocean
churned by an angry wind, so that the waves toss to and fro. The breath
changes. The shoulders tighten. There is a restlessness, and it seems as
though it is difficult to maintain comfort and ease. The *egoic* voice,
which is the voice of fear, the voice of guilt, the voice of
self-judgment, the voice of unworthiness to be what God has created you
to be, that voice always creates inner turmoil and loss of peace.
Therefore, merely observe it. Do not seek to be rid of it, but just
learn to observe it as it is.

> Oh, I’ve asked the question within and asked for guidance, and
> immediately my mind became disturbed, my body’s changed and tightened,
> and I’m thinking about all manner of things that are ‘out there.’ This,
> surely, is not the Voice of the Comforter. Therefore, I will simply ask
> again.

Simply return to the acknowledgment of who you are and ask again, as
we’ve suggested. Begin to observe, then, as the body begins to relax,
that you need only say within the mind,

> In Truth, I do not know what a single thing is or is for. I am here to
> learn what it means to be awake, to be the <span class="tr_normal">embodiment of Love</span>. 
> And there is one Teacher given unto me who guides always correctly.

Merely then, ask your questions again. And notice the effect. Say within
the mind,

> I am not attached to the answer, for I trust Love to direct my course.

When you begin to observe that the mind, your beingness, is less and
less attached to the outcome that you’re looking for, then the Voice of
the Comforter can begin to speak to you. You’ve heard it often said that
God speaks to you as a small, still, quiet Voice. This is the opposite
of the world’s thinking. Therefore, as you cultivate the ability to rest
in silence, to be detached from any need to have the answer look a
certain way, more and more you will access that place in the depth of
the mind, or the heart, in which the Comforter dwells at One with you.

Remember that the Holy Spirit is merely *right-mindedness*.
Right-mindedness, correct seeing, correct feeling, is that that is
aligned with the Will of God. That right-mindedness was placed within
you by God Herself, if you will. So you are truly listening only to the
*depth* of *your own being*, what we have referred to often as the *heart*, as
a way of drawing a distinction from the thinking, restless mind.

It is in silence that the Voice of the Comforter speaks. And silence
comes when you are no longer invested in the outcome of the contexts or
decisions that confront you. You will know that you are truly guided
when a picture, a thought, even a voice, a feeling in the heart, comes
and your whole being resonates with it. Therefore, there is no conflict.
There’s no tug of war any longer. There’s a moment of simple
knowingness. It is not the kind of thing that needs to be explained to
anyone. It is not the kind of thing that you question or mull over in
your mind. It is a simple, immediate knowing.

> This is the right decision.
> 
> This is the journey I must make.
> 
> This is the book I must read.
> 
> This is the relationship I’m to be in, or not to be in (it doesn’t
> matter).

The point is, you *feel* in your beingness a clarity, a resonance, that
indicates you have stepped into a state of *wholeness*. You *know* what you
*know*, and there is only certainty.

Then, of course, the next step is to *follow through*. The voice of the
ego will rise again a thousand times, debating with you. And why?
Because the voice of the ego, again, is that voice made up by you as a
result of your guilt and fear and your belief that you are *unworthy* to
be One with God, that your innocence has been tainted, that, therefore,
the Creator has forgotten you. This is never the case. You are loved
wholly. You have never sinned. And you remain as you are created to be.
And your Creator merely waits for you to awaken from the dream of
unworthiness and to take up your rightful place as His creation, that
the *good*, the *holy*, and the *beautiful* can be extended through you in the
very act of creation.

Beloved friend, guidance is something that is *learned* in the field of
time. It occurs to the degree that you are willing to stop thinking for
yourself. It comes to the degree that you are willing to set aside the
guidance of everyone around you--and if you open yourself to that,
you’ll find there are many just waiting to tell you what you should do.
It comes as the result of your willingness to begin to turn every
decision over to the Friend, the Teacher, the Comforter, that has been
placed in the depth of your mind and your heart by God. And God is but
Love.

Therefore, to cultivate tuning into, resonating with, listening, and
then following that Voice in the depth of your heart means that you are
learning to let *Love* be your guide, *Love* be your teacher, *Love* be your
friend. And that Love is universal. That Love is eternal. And that Love
is within you *now*! You cannot be alone at any time. And all power under
Heaven and Earth is given unto you to guide and shape your journey
through time. And over time, you will become a master of tuning into
guidance.

Making the direction toward the Kingdom of Heaven, you will learn to go
only to that altar and not to the altar of the world. And as miracles
occur, as success builds upon success, you will learn that after all is
said and done, the world has been wrong. You are not alone. You do not
need to make your way. Your way will be made *for you* by a Power and Love
and Intelligence that birthed you in the first place and has only your
highest good in mind.

Practice well then, beloved friend. Look to see how you can begin to
turn decisions over. Begin with those that are quite simple, so that
fear does not arise. Begin, for instance, by simply asking,

> What would be the best thing I could put in my body for breakfast?
> 
> Which of these two movies would I most enjoy?

And then, practice listening for the inner guidance. Again, in this way,
you begin with situations that are fairly ‘safe’ for you. And then you
can progress to ‘bigger’ decisions, until, ultimately, every decision is
turned over--even the most ordinary decisions. Not in a way that
anybody will see or notice, but your mind has been corrected, so that in
each moment, you’re quietly asking,

> Father/Mother God, what would you have me do? For only your plan works,
> and only your pathway is strewn with the flowers of miracles, and
> wisdom, and peace, and the fulfillment of my soul.

Begin practicing, beloved friend, making the decision to turn every
decision over to the quiet place within where the Friend, the Teacher,
waits for you.

## <span class="tr_hide">Question Two</span> {#l01q2}

<!-- -filter -->

<!-- Track q2 -->

*Question Two*: Jeshua, you have mentioned that all events are neutral —
several times. Could you please take that and go deeper with that and
explain it for us?

*Answer*: Beloved friend, I would be most pleased to do this for you,
except that your question is a neutral event that has no interest!
[Laughter] Hmm.

Now you have, indeed, heard it said to you many times, and I’m certainly
not the first one to share this, that *all events are neutral*. What do we
mean by this?

There is a moment, unknown by the world’s thinking. It goes unperceived,
unnoticed by those who live their lives *seduced* by the shadows that make
up the world, because they are run by fear, by judgment, by doubt, by
guilt. This is like a turbulence in the mind that covers up the
simplicity of the moment we’re referring to. There is a *moment* in each
and every one of your experiences where an event begins to arise, a gap
if you would say so, in which your mind is not *interpreting* the event.
It is merely *arising*. This is its reality, its “suchness,” if you will.
It simply arises. You don’t know where it came from. It arises from
Mystery. For in Truth, no one--*no one*--can say why there is anything
at all. It arises from Mystery--energy dancing in an endless shape of
forms, beginning, passing by, and then ending.

The world in which you live, this world of energy called your physical
dimension, is like a constant *light show*--energy dancing, cascading,
changing. There is a moment of perfect peace, a moment that can be
cultivated to be expanded, so that your mind notices the *innocence* of
each event. But the *perception of innocence requires the healing of
fear*.

I’ve shared with you many times that there are fundamentally only two
emotions, if you will, only two worlds, or two realities: Love and fear.
And between these two, only one is Real: Love. For God is Love and does
not create unlike Herself. Fear, then, must be healed within the mind
and the body, as long as the body lasts, in order that the mind can
perceive this *moment of innocence*...watching a wave arise out of the
Ocean of Mystery without a need to judge it, without a need to hold up a
placard and say,

> We’ll give it a five or a nine.
> 
> No, that’s a bad wave.
> 
> This is a good wave.
> 
> What will this wave do to me?
> 
> Oh, I don’t want this wave!

You know all of that kind of thinking.

There is a moment in which the *perfect innocence* of each event is
*undisturbed*.

What, then, occurs to change a *neutral* event into one *charged* with
meaning? Listen well, beloved friend, for here is the whole crux of the
very problem, if you will, which requires you to awaken from it.

*Perception* takes place. Perception is like a *coloring*. Imagine that you
had a pair of sunglasses, and as you walked outside, you had them in
your hand, not on your eyes. And for a moment, you saw things just as
they are. And then, in the next moment, you’re putting the blue-colored
lenses over your eyes. Immediately, the world, that which you are
experiencing, has been colored in a certain way.

Perception is much like this. The only difference being that the lenses
are *deep within your mind*. The lenses are made up of all of the beliefs
and perceptions and attitudes that you have taken on from others around
you as you sought to adapt yourself to this world. It creates beliefs.
And you will literally believe that what you see is ‘out there’--when,
in fact, you’re merely looking through the lens, the prism, the lenses
of your own mind. This is why I have often said there is nothing outside
of you.

Therefore, when you experience any event, notice your responses. And
then, if you truly desire peace, stop trying to *justify* your
perceptions. And rather, go within and ask with the innocent wonder of a
child,

> I wonder why I’m choosing to see this event this way? I wonder if I
> could see it differently? Perhaps what looks like a trauma is offering
> me a treasure, if only I could become quiet and ask the Comforter for
> guidance.

The reality of your ‘world’ is this--listen carefully: *It does not
exist*. That is, it is not occurring outside of your own mind. Mind is
all there is. And freedom comes from the willingness to take
responsibility for it, that the Mystery which brings forth all events
can be seen the way you *want* to see it--from freedom, from power, from
safety, from peace, *from Love rather than fear*.

Because you are made by your Creator to create, you are creating without
ceasing. And until awakening comes (and that’s another subject) you
literally are creating the world of your experience through the lenses
of your own perceptions. You are free at any time to heal those
perceptions and to learn to see differently--eventually to see through
the Eyes of Christ. And Christ is just the reflection of the Love that
God is.

Regardless of what the egoic part of the mind will say, this one thing
never changes: *All events remain perfectly neutral*. What value and
meaning, then, can they have? They will have the meaning and value that
emerges from your decision about which *voice* to listen to--the voice of
the ego, which is the voice of fear and judgment and unworthiness, or
the Voice of Love, in which the Comforter translates the events of time
and shows you how they can be utilized for your own awakening and
healing; and, by extension, the awakening and healing of the world,
itself. This is a Voice that the Christ within you listens to. It is the
Voice that speaks of forgiveness, the Voice that speaks of fearlessness,
the Voice that speaks of wisdom, and of patience. It is the Voice that
serves only one purpose--that purpose which can bring each of God’s
Children Home again, to uplift them to the peace that they seek, out of
the suffering of guilt that they’ve been used to.

One who is fully awake, in the field of time, looks to be very ordinary.
But in their mind, their consciousness, they’ve been given over to
letting the Holy Spirit interpret every series of events *for* them. And
the Holy Spirit will interpret events *only* in the way that serves the
awakening process. Events no longer have any other purpose than the
correction, deep in the mind, that allows Love to be remembered and
restored, so that Creation can flow without obstacle.

You will know that you are listening to the voice of the ego when you
*argue for the correctness of your perception*. Learn well, then, beloved
friend, again by practicing innocently, to recognize that all events are
neutral. You can do this in a way that I’ve explained many times through
many channels. Merely give yourself five minutes a day in which you sit
in a chair and observe the things around you. And each time your eyes
fall upon an object or perhaps hear the phone ring, or what have you,
you merely say,

> I do not know what this is or is for. I don’t even know how it got here.
> I rest in innocence, and place no judgment upon it.

In this way, you begin to cultivate the mind to let the gap widen, in
which, within your mind, the *moment of innocence* lingers long enough for
you to be aware of it. Eventually, you could literally be *crucified* by
beings who swear they hate you, and you would look upon it with
equanimity and peace, saying simply,

> Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. This is simply a
> neutral event. And I remain One with God.

Practice well, beloved friend, and look. You’ll begin to discover what
you are still valuing, where you’re still holding on to your need to be
right about your perceptions. And merely invite the Comforter to change
your mind for you.

That should be sufficient for now.

## <span class="tr_hide">Question Three</span> {#l01q3}

<!-- -filter -->

<!-- Track q3 -->

*Question Three*: Please explain more about the paradox of living as one Christ
Consciousness and yet also living in an individuated body and ego.

*Answer*: Beloved friend, please listen well as we give you the punch
line. In Christed Awareness, it is *impossible* to live as an individuated
mind or ego, since Christed Awareness is becoming established in the
*transcendence* of the old misperception that you are living inside a body
and peering out through it and are, therefore, separated from others
because of the distance between bodies. In Christed Awareness, you
literally feel and know your identity to be *Spirit*. And Spirit embraces
all things. You literally recognize that there is nothing outside of
you.

Yes, it is quite true that the body-mind you once used to be identified
with is still going on. But it has been *translated*. It has been
*transformed* because your perception of it has been corrected. You
realize that your ability to be aware is the very gift of God that
created you in the first place. That power to be aware is the power of
Spirit Itself. Therefore, it is no longer ‘my’ body-mind, ‘my’ egoic
mind, it is just ‘the’ body, ‘the’ mind. And it is given over with every
breath, with every thought, to Spirit.

So, that’s the punch line. As you ask the question, it is impossible.
You cannot live as Christed Mind and still be an individuated body and
ego.

The highest state of consciousness, then, is a state in which perception
has been corrected. And the body-mind walks upon the planet as long as
it lasts, but now, instead of being you, it is a simple tool for Spirit.
You’re no longer identified *as* it, or *with* it. You look at your hands
and your feet, you look at the head, you look at the thoughts that come
and go, and you realize that the body-mind could never possibly have any
purpose or value except that which God gives it. And you have
surrendered ownership. You said,

> Father, it’s pretty evident that I haven’t known how to live happily,
> joyfully, and at peace. I give myself--I give all of this--back to
> You. You use it. And I’ll go where You want me to go. I’ll take the
> carcass, the body, wherever You want it to go. It no longer matters to
> me. I am here only to be at peace and to offer this body-mind as a
> possible way through which Love can be revealed to another, through
> which wisdom can be given to the world. I’m not even attached to that;
> all things are yours.

Therefore, beloved friend, as you go through your day, begin to notice
how you are thinking about the body itself. How many times do you say
‘my’ body, ‘my’ ego, ‘my’ thoughts? Begin to create some distance by
simply saying ‘the’ body, ‘the’ egoic mind (which is really not the
possession of anybody; it’s just a temporary quality of mind that many
beings seem to be sharing), ‘the’ thoughts. If you were sitting next to
your ocean, and you were watching waves arise and fall, would you say,

> That wave is mine and nobody else’s?

Of course not. You would say,

> Oh, there goes a wave.

Can you teach yourself, during the course of your day, to do the same
thing?

> Oh, the body is washing dishes.
> 
> The body is walking upon the grass.
> 
> Oh, there are thoughts passing through the mind.

Can you become the *Witness*, or the observer, of what is arising and
passing away? For the more that you develop the quality of the Witness,
the more the world becomes transparent, and the more you realize that
you are the Watcher of all thoughts. You are the Seer of all things. You
are Spirit. You are like the ocean in which waves arise and pass away.
And you begin to become identified--not as the body, not as the
particular personality or history--you’ll become identified as that
which embraces and trusts and allows all things. You will be Spirit. And
*then* you will know the answer to your question, for it cannot be
answered with the intellect. It can only be *known* and lived directly.

That should give this one pause.

## <span class="tr_hide">Question Four</span> {#l01q4}

<!-- Track q4 -->

*Question Four*: Can you talk about what the perception of the New Age movement
is regarding ‘up and out,’ riding the ascending current and ignoring
what we call the ‘shadow side,’ and how to balance the...not to be
in denial of the shadow? Can you just discuss that--riding the
ascending and descending currents (in less than ten minutes)?

*Answer*: Beloved friend, this would be a very good question to devote an
entire hour to, or perhaps several hours. And yet, I will give the
answer to you in two minutes. The only question will be, will you be
able to *realize* that Truth in the seven or eight that are then left to
you? [Laughter]

Here is the answer: *The Seeker must become the Finder.* The desire to
ride the ascending current is a subtle aspect of *seeking experience*. The
heart that is awake embraces *all* things, trusts all things, denies
nothing. And if you are in this world, what you call the ‘shadow’ can be
loved as easily as any ascending mystical experience. The desire to ride
that current is nothing more than the desire to avoid something. If you
know that you are Spirit, there is nowhere to go to. There is only the
loving embrace of that which is, that it might be restored to a moment
through which Love is extended.

Therefore, *embrace* all things, *trust* all things, *allow* all things,
*transcend* all things. That should be sufficient for now. But within it,
there is much to be contemplated.

Did I accomplish it within the two minutes?

*Response*: You did an excellent job.

*Jeshua*: Hmm! It is because I spent so much time riding the ascending current.
[Laughter]. But more than this, it is because I spent time embracing the
sinner, the sin, the illusion of suffering, and bringing Love to my
brothers and sisters--by turning to look at what I thought was
darkness, only to discover that within it was the Light of God, and that
nothing could harm me in any way. *I became free when I stopped seeking
God, and allowed God to find me.*

Therefore, the one who seeks to go *somewhere* is just playing the same
egoic pattern. *Only Love is Real.* And in *that moment* [snaps fingers],
Christ is present. The Atonement is completed. The Master has arisen in
the twinkling of an eye.

So...But again, we want to suggest that you create a context in
which that question can be given much deeper consideration.

So, to those of you present, know that nothing comes by accident. And
you have chosen to set aside your time. You have chosen to set aside
your time to be in this room, not by accident, but because, *already*,
there is a place within you that knows how to listen to the guidance of
your heart. Therefore, *trust that guidance in all things*. You are *not*
alone. And the power of the Love of God is with you even now, and will
be throughout all eternity.

Peace, then, be unto you always.

Amen.
