<!-- Track q1 -->

*Question One:* What motivates you? How does an enlightened person move
throughout his or her day? Apparently you have moved into a state of
Oneness with Source, yet you still have a distinct, unique personality.
You are still a Self, yet you are also One with God. Can you describe
what this state is like for us?

*Answer:* Beloved friend. What motivates me? Worldly accolades. Being hung
on so many walls in so many churches across the world. Hmm . . . All of
the many priests and ministers who make a very good living professing to
teach my teaching, although they teach fear, and guilt, and judgment.
Hmm. What motivates me? The bets that I have placed with my “comrades in
arms,” who often believe that I’m wasting my time with humanity. For
there are, indeed, many Masters in many dimensions that wouldn’t touch
this plane with a ten-thousand foot pole. And yet, I say unto you,
beloved friend, I speak somewhat tongue-in-cheek, although I don’t have
one.

What motivates *me* is what must come to motivate *you* when the Christ Mind
is awakened within your being, and has come to outshine any other
possibility. For what will motivate you is the deep appreciation for the
Grace that has healed your mind, the great Mystery from which you have
arisen, that somehow reaches into your illusions and brings you Home.
You know not how. *Love* of your Creator will motivate you as you become
more and more empty of self, empty of fear, empty of the need to
survive, empty of everything unlike Love, and more and more conformed to
the *instrument of peace*.

Beloved friend, what motivates me is the very fact that you exist, and
that, at times, within you, your soul has cried out to come Home. And
because my Father has brought me home, because I know how perfect it is,
how can I not extend myself to you? So to my many comrades, who seem to
wish to avoid ever taking on the human experience, I simply, politely,
nod my non-physical head and say,

> Well yes, but you see, I know that no one goes Home until everyone goes
> Home.

I am merely your brother. And I seem to have gone ahead of you a little
while. And yet, I say this unto you, *The Way of the Heart* must cultivate
within you — and will — the recognition that there is no one and nothing
outside of you, and that only Love has the power to heal. And,
therefore, everyone that comes into your life is an aspect of your
savior, teaching you to cultivate the forgiveness, and the patience, and
the willingness to hear not the voice of ego within you, but to trust
the guidance of the Holy Spirit in all matters, regardless of how insane
it may seem to the world. What motivates me is the Grace that released
me from all illusion, even as that Grace is already at work
accomplishing the same within you.

What does it mean to go through the day in an enlightened state? I would
be happy to tell you, only I have no days, for a day is a function of
time. Time is something I no longer know anything about. It is not
something that pervades my beingness. I abide only in what is eternal.
And when fear has been completely uprooted from within your beingness,
you, too, will know timelessness. There is a message in that answer. I
hope you’re listening.

Beloved friend, what is it like to be One with the Source of all
Creation, and yet to hold an individuated consciousness? Why not ask
yourself? You know perfectly well. For in Reality, you *are* One with the
Source. And again, as the message of this hour has shared, you are
acting from your infinite perfection at all times, to call qualities of
experience, qualities of energy to yourself. That is exactly what I do.
The only difference is, I have chosen to call only that of the *highest
possible vibrations*, while you are choosing to say to yourself and to
me,

> Well, yes, yes. All that bliss stuff is fine, but I’d still like to get
> a little taste of drama and suffering. I just want to make sure I’ve got
> this down before I leave this plane.

In all respects, the choosing mechanism within you is equal to that
within me. Therefore, understand well, if you would know what it means
to know you are One with your Creator, while yet exhibiting an
individuality, simply begin to observe your own mind, your own choices,
your own experiences, with perfect innocence, constantly reminding
yourself that the Truth is true always. As a sunbeam can never escape
the sun, as a wave can never escape the ocean, you remain as you are
created to be. And you are given *infinite* and *perfect freedom*, because
you are made in the image of God.

Therefore, beloved friend, consider well what you would desire and what
your intention will be. Ask yourself, moment to moment,

> What am I truly committed unto? For what I am committed to is the focus
> of my intention. And the intention that I focus on brings to me the
> fulfillment of my desire. And what I am experiencing, like it or not, is
> <span class="tr_normal">always</span> the <span class="tr_normal">effect</span> of 
> my <span class="tr_normal">desire</span>.

*Question Two:* Would you please comment on the world of sexuality and sexual
expression for those of us committed to a path of spiritual evolution?

*Answer:* Well, indeed, beloved friend, if you would be committed to a
role of genuine spiritually, you must put that which is called, I
believe, the *chastity belt* upon the body. You must separate yourself
from all those who seem to elicit little tickles of sensations in your
body. Hmm. You must banish from yourself all thought of another body
next to yours. Hmm. And if these things arise, by all means, whip
yourself! Hmm!

Beloved friend, I’ve said many times that *all events are neutral, all
experiences are neutral*. They will be, therefore, precisely what *you
choose* them to be. Sexuality ... In your world, most minds take this
to mean that there is some sort of juxtapositioning of physical bodies,
some groping of the hands, and the lips, and the tongues, and what have
you. But, indeed, this is only the outer reflection, or the symbolic
expression, of the energies being held within the mind.

It is most appropriate to say that all of Creation is an act of
sexuality. It is an expression of energy which wishes to birth forth
with *great passion — Creation!* And all relationships between two bodies,
or between the moon and the sun, between the Earth and the sky — all
forms of relationship are inherently the same. They hold within
themselves the promise, and the purpose, and the challenge of
discovering the *unity* between the two or the three or the ten. It
doesn’t matter.

Therefore, sexuality, as you understand it in your world, is only what
you will choose it to be. It does not, *necessarily*, accelerate your
awakening. And it does not, *necessarily*, impede it. What you approach
with sanctity and purity of heart, what you approach in every
relationship, what you approach from the recognition that Creation
streams forth only from the Mind of God and, therefore, the Light of
Love, the presence of Christ is present in that one before whom you
stand or, perhaps, whom you lay next to. What you approach with *sanctity*
is sanctified. What you approach with *secretness*, what you approach with
*neediness*, is demoralized and destroyed.

I would say unto you, beloved friend, you cannot transcend what is not
first embraced. Therefore, search the soul well, to see if there is any
*fear* of the great *intimacy* and *vulnerability* that can be experienced in
sexuality. Is there something in you conflicted that is not allowing you
to truly drink in the beauty of the physical form of another, to pause
over every curve and every dimple, and even every little hair upon the
body? Can you see within *this* grand Mystery? Can you pause long enough
to lose the false self? Can you *sanctify* the touching of flesh? For I
say unto you, you are the creator of what you experience.

Sexuality is a grand thing! Let no one tell you that I avoided it when I
was a man. After all, that’s the whole point. I was, after all, a man.
But I *sanctified* it to keep it holy. And sexuality can be experienced in
its totality merely by looking into the eyes of another and setting
yourself aside, and asking only to see the Face of Christ. For
sexuality, the great longing within humanity, is to find some method,
some way to transcend the *fear*, the *guilt*, the *deep contraction* which is
ego, to find some way to slip through the cracks and experience some
momentary bliss of the unity of Oneness.

But I say unto you, cultivate the Reality of your Oneness within
yourself. And, indeed, you will find that all relationships, whether you
be with a body, with a blade of grass, or with the wind that touches
your skin, will feel like a sexual experience, as long as the body
lasts. Let then, this energy *fill* you. Feel the *bliss* and the *pleasure*
and the *joy* of sensuality and sexuality. See it happening all over the
place on your planet because, without it, the planet wouldn’t even
exist.

Beloved friend, have you not ever watched little children who run naked
through the fields and play with their genitals without the least bit of
thought? They derive from it a moment of pleasure and occasionally, they
may touch each other. There is no judgment in this. There is only
innocence. And the adults look and go,

> Oh, isn’t that cute?

And some of them go,

> Oh! Oh my God! Charlie, please, cover that up! You can’t do that!

Hmm.

> Mary, put your dress back down!

Why? What is the adult afraid of, if not Life itself?

And make not of sexuality a specialness, but rather, cultivate within it
the sanctified state of consciousness in which you are deliberately
choosing to set aside yourself, to *let Christ love Christ*. Sexuality is
a rather good thing, if you choose to use the power of your beingness to
*sanctify* it, that it may be *holy*. For what is *holy* gives rise to
*wholeness*. And what is fragmented through fear, through guilt, through
neediness, through mere lust, what is thus fragmented leads to
fragmentation within one’s consciousness.

Bless sexuality. Let it become sanctified. And set aside all of those
incarnations you held as a nun in monasteries, listening to false ideas
out of someone else’s fear of the body. It is only a communication
device. What would you, therefore, choose to communicate through your
experience of sexuality?

Be at peace, beloved friend, and while the body lasts my suggestion to
you would be: Enjoy it!

<!-- Track q3 -->

*Question Three:* I understand healing as Jeshua speaks of it in *A Course in
Miracles*, yet what needs to occur for bodily symptoms to no longer be in
one’s experience?

*Answer:* Beloved friend, as I have spoken of healing in that text which
you know as *A Course in Miracles*, is, indeed, the fundamental definition
of healing. By considering it, it must flush up within you all the
deeply held hopes and prayers and beliefs and need to have healing be
something that also manifests the perfection of the function of the
body, according to your desire of what that perfection should be.

What is necessary, then, for the removal of physical symptoms? The
miracle. But the miracle is not something which is under your control.
Listen well to the message of this session, for I’ve indicated already
to you, and *deliberately* indicated, the answer to your question and you
will find it there. For, rest assured beloved friend, when there arises
within the mind the hope or the wish that a physical symptom would leave
the body, there must already be the enactment of an ancient belief that
the body is what you are. And that, therefore, disease of some kind, as
you would call it this, limits your ability to extend Love, to
communicate with all of Creation, and to be at peace.

You may rest assured that when my many friends saw me with a crown of
thorns upon my head, they thought,

> Oh, poor Loved One,

out of the belief that certainly spirituality must mean the power to
overcome everything the mind has judged as a dis-ease.

The point that I’m seeking to reach with you is an attempt to dig deep
within the depth of your psyche, to bring to the surface with you an
ancient belief that true spirituality is recognized by all absence of
disease, and that if you were truly whole, it would never arise within
the body. Yet I say this unto you: What if every moment of your
experience was literally being brought to you of the Father, Who alone
knows the perfect plan for the healing of your mind?

Remember: *It is not possible to transcend what is not wholly loved*.
Therefore, place the attention on deepening the *love of Self*, the
exploration of the experience that has been called to the consciousness,
through the form of dis-ease, of whatever kind. Learn to look upon it
with the perfect innocence that you would look upon anything else. And
see through it to see that it does not limit you in any way from being
the unlimited presence of Love. It is not a weakness. And it is not to
be compared to what may appear to be a diseaseless body. For the eyes of
the body do not show what is within another’s soul.

Beloved friend, there is a part of you that carries an ancient tear. Let
it be released and healing will come.
