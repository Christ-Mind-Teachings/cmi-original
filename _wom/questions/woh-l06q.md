*Question One:* How can I integrate the breath work and techniques that I am
learning this week with your lessons in the *Course in Miracles*?

*Answer:* Beloved friend, the question comes from a quality of mind that
would perceive a separation between the two. For only what is perceived
as *separate* must be *integrated*. Know well, then, that *A Course in
Miracles* is a teaching device aimed at a specific goal or conclusion.
That conclusion or goal is the re-establishment of peace. Peace begins
to be re-established in the mind when the mind is convinced that there
is a way of perceiving, a way of orienting itself to its experience,
that brings a greater reward than what has been known before.

*A Course in Miracles* was given initially to two people who had asked
from the depth of their being (although they were not aware of it at the
time) to be shown a way to perceive differently. A wise teacher first
learns the language of the student. And the two that asked the question
carried an orientation in which their primary mechanism for experience
was through the level of the mind, or the intellect. Therefore, the
teaching tool needed to be conveyed in a way that could be acceptable to
them as the student.

Secondarily, of course, as you well know, the essential message that I
sought to bring forth through that teaching device is equally applicable
to anyone who may be attracted to pursuing the study of it. And yet, the
*Course* does not seek to answer every question that a teacher of God
will, indeed, come to ask. It is designed only to re-establish the mind
at peace, and to cultivate within that mind the willingness to ask of
what I’ve called the *Comforter*, or the Holy Spirit, for guidance, rather
than remaining attached to its own devices for decision making. This
opens the way for the mind to be guided ever more deeply to what is
required to become fully re-established as the embodiment of Love.

What you have called here “breath work” is merely a next stepping stone.
Those who would hold that the *Course in Miracles* is a complete teaching
device within itself are accurate, if they understand that it was given
to those who are deeply embedded within the intellectual processes, and
that it has a specific goal that is self-contained. Those that would
assert that viewing the Course in Miracles as a complete teaching tool
in itself, if they take this to mean that there is nothing further to
explore, nothing further to deepen and become, are inaccurate. View it
then, as a *teaching device* with a *specific goal*, given in a way that is
acceptable to those who have learned to abide primarily in the level of
mind that is engaged in conceptualization.

I answer your question this way because the body, itself, is not outside
of the Mind. It arises from within the Mind. And you can, therefore,
look upon it and what arises within it, to witness the effects of the
thoughts that are actually occurring within the Mind, or have occurred
in the past, and have not been corrected or changed. Mind is far
reaching. Mind is everything, as the term is used within that teaching
device. It should always be spelled with a capital M. Mind also
encompasses feeling. Mind encompasses the body itself. For without the
Mind’s first having chosen the thought, the imagination, there could not
even be a physical realm in the first place.

When you choose, therefore, to allow yourself to breathe, recognize that
it is from the *power to decide*, that is, the *power of the Mind to choose*
that you are creating the effect of allowing the aspect of the Mind,
known as the body, to also receive illumination. To integrate *A Course
in Miracles* with what you are calling “breath work,” and what I have
addressed earlier in this hour as the way of feeling, and what, indeed,
we have called for the whole of this year *The Way of the Heart*, requires
only the continued *little willingness* to surrender any and all limited
perceptions of what Life is, and what awakening is, and what Love is,
and what healing is, so that the Holy Spirit can guide you into the
Truth of all things.

For, indeed, beloved friend, understand well that what was shared
earlier deeply pertains to you. Namely this: When, from the depth of
your being, you have fully committed to awakening from every last trace
of separation from God, when you are truly committed to not seeking for
Love, but you are willing to seek for all of the obstacles that have
been created within you that block the awareness of Love’s presence,
then, indeed, what you find yourself attracted to, what you find
yourself deciding for, in terms of the experiences that you would call
to yourself, these things are the answer to your prayer. For just as my
*Course in Miracles* came to your life, as you well know, as the result of
your own longing to deepen your relationship with God, so, too, have you
found yourself journeying to a tiny speck of dust in the middle of a
large body of water — to breathe!

It is an extension and comes from the guidance of the Comforter, the
Holy Spirit. Therefore, the integration is simple. Decide not for
yourself, but turn decisions over to the Holy Spirit. And then, take
what He has guided you toward and make it part of your life. And trust,
in faith, that all these things are not without purpose. Ask only that
every aspect, every tiny corner of your Mind become so illuminated, so
healed, that only Christ abides where even there seems to be the body.

<!-- Track q2 -->

*Question Two:* Can you speak about the need, or lack of need, to work
directly with the dark side, both on the physical and astral plane?

*Answer:* Yes, I can do that. [Pause]

*Question:* Will you?

*Answer:* That is another matter.

Indeed, beloved friend, first look well and understand the place within
that would draw a line and decide what is *light* and what is *dark*. For
remember that suffering comes from a split mind, a mind that sees
conflict, division, separation. If it is true that only Love heals — and
I assure you that it is — can you look upon what you have called
darkness and discover the light within it by shining light upon it? Are
there dark forces in the realm of experience, within the realm of
Creation, as you know it? Yes, but I do not mean by this that there is a
force separate from you or separate from the reach of God’s Love that
holds the power to direct, influence, or control you in any way.
Darkness ... As the journey that you’re on begins to end, you will
come to see that darkness is nothing more than a part of your own
beingness which has been neglected and not loved. For when you love what
you perceive as darkness, you reclaim it as a part of yourself. And by
loving it, you transform it. And the power you had given it by
separating it from you, returns to you where it truly abides.

Is there a difference between what could be called darkness in the realm
in which you live and move and have your being, seemingly as a body in
space and time, and that which you call the astral realms? No!
Everything exists right where you are. For you abide as fully on those
realms as you do sitting on the floor in this moment. An astral realm is
made such only because you have withdrawn your awareness of it and
sought to constrict it merely into the physical dimension. Therefore,
peering out from within a body, it looks like there is another
dimension, that you choose to call the astral realm, where things are
hidden from your view. They’re not hidden at all. They are merely
inaccessible if you use the apparatus of the physical eyes. But if you
use the eye within, nothing is hidden.

What is astral and what energies abide therein are, therefore, nothing more
than that which abides within your own consciousness, your own mind. And what
is the way of working and dealing with those dark forces? Where you are in your
third-dimensional experience as a body-mind requires only that you look
lovingly upon your brother or your sister, that you *touch* them, if you will,
with your words, with your smile, with the tips of your fingers, with the words
you speak, so that Love is extended and forgiveness given. For those many
forces and beings that seem to reside in realms unseen, called by many an
astral realm, the strategy, if you will, is perfectly identical. It is one and
the same thing, because only Love can heal.

Think well upon what is given unto you in this answer. Contemplate it
deeply. Within three weeks’ time, given the current momentum of your
mind, you will begin to have some rather interesting revelations. You
will literally feel the mind, shall we say, being rewired, shifting to a
whole new level of perception, understanding, and natural ability. For
what seems to be unseen on the astral realms ... you will then begin
to move in the direction of seeing it as clearly as you do the hand
before your face. Pleasant journeys!

## <span class="tr_hide">Question Three</span> {#l06q3}

<!-- Track q3 -->

*Question Three:* How can I tell the difference between old ego habits of
feeling and feelings which need to be felt to completion?

*Answer:* First, beloved friend, is there a difference? Your experience is
always of and in the present. For what arises is not past, it is now. Is
it an old ego pattern? Perhaps. If there is a sense of constriction, a
sense of resistance, a sense of judgment of self or another, rest
assured, that which has arisen to temporarily dominate your attention is
an egoic pattern, since the ego is, by definition, the constriction away
from Love. And therefore, the loss of peace is its result.

Look well, then, and simply recognize,

> What is arising in this moment? Am I willing to look upon it, to feel
> it, to embrace it?

And as we would perceive and observe, you’re beginning to recognize,

> Am I willing, yet, to breathe?

For *to breathe is Life*!

*Feel*, then, what you are truly feeling. *Observe* what is truly present
within the mind. In this way, you take your hands and cup them around
whatever that is. And you’ve done that, then recognize this great Truth:

> I can choose again. And I can choose peace instead of this.

Now the “this” is not so much the picture of what you might call a
memory or a feeling or something that’s coming up. The “this” speaks to
your *judgment*, your *perception* of what is arising. *You can choose peace
instead of the perception that steals your peace.* And that is the place
of infinite and perfect power to literally transform your life!

Beloved friend, the past does not exist at any moment. If the Mind is
causing, bringing forth, a picture or a thought that seems to be
reminiscent of the past by your own decree, rest assured that it is
arising in *this present moment*, which is the only place creation and
experience occur. The past, then, can exist for you only if you
re-create it now. This re-creation does not mean that an image or a
picture can not arise in the mind, what you call memory, although, it is
a very present experience. We are speaking here of the experience you
created when that same picture appeared in your experience in a
different time frame. Your experience is never caused by what arises in
your field of awareness. Your experience — listen well — your experience
is how you have chosen to *react* in the *emotional* and *mental field*, to a
*neutral event* that has arisen. All events are *neutral*. *The reaction to
them is what generates experience.*

When nails were driven through my hands, that was an *entirely neutral
event*, although, by the way, many friends scurried about. It didn’t
*appear* to be so neutral. But it was neutral for *me*. Therefore,
understand beloved friend, that whatever events have *ever* unfolded in
the realm of your experience, *each and every one of them was perfectly
neutral, until you responded with the reaction that you were choosing in
order to create an experience in the emotional body, in order to create
a learning experience about the potentials of your own consciousness*.

Forgiveness, healing, peace, and awakening are equally *potentials* within
your own mind. Equal to and, indeed, even greater than, anything that
you have experienced heretofore. Therefore, understand, beloved friend:
Nothing has been *caused* by anything or anyone outside yourself. What
arises is always present experience. Embrace it, look upon it, claim it,
own it, feel it, breathe through it, and then recognize that you are
free to choose again.

Herein lies the straight and narrow path that leads to *Life*! And you
have a friend, currently without a body, who wants nothing more than to
witness your *true Living*. And you have countless friends, with bodies,
who share the same desire.

Be you, therefore, that which you are! And live from the power given
unto you, from the freedom in which you abide always — as the Love that
you are!
