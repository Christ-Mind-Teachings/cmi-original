*Question One:* Can you elaborate on the importance of our natal charts and
the different influences and energies that transits in astrology bring?

*Answer:* As I have shared with you before, it is appropriate to say that
the soul chooses to enter into a field of energy that has a certain
*flavor* to it. And that flavor is the *matrix of vibrations* that makes up
the energy field of creation in the dimension that you’re entering at
the time of your birth.

Nothing arises by accident. And those children that delay their birth,
or speed it up, are simply trying to, shall we say, get to the “train
station” before it leaves. They don’t want to be too late or too early,
because they’ve already decided which “car” they’re going to be sitting
in. And why? Because when they do so, they create for themselves a
certain flavor, a certain sphere of energy, a certain creative matrix,
certain fields of energies that set up the learning situations within
their own consciousness. They then attract the situations, the friends,
the relationships that can express — what would you call this — the
*flushing up* of those energies that the soul is choosing to explore, and
play with, and master.

It’s really not all that complex. It’s very, very simple. The danger
comes when the mind looks upon its intellectual understanding of those
matrices, those fields of energy, those certain flavors, and believes
that the *power* is in *them*. That is like a carpenter suddenly becoming
deluded and looking at the hammer and saw on the table, and then,
sitting back and waiting for the hammer and saw to build the house.

Take up the tools, take up the qualities that make up your beingness,
that even influence how the genes of the body generate energy, how they
digest foods, all of the preferences and likes and dislikes. And begin
to see these things as symbolic:

> What energies am I choosing to experience?

Why do I hate the country so much and love the city?

Why do I hate the city so much and love the country?

Why do I love the snow and hate the sun?

Why I do love the sun and hate the snow?

These are energies, matrices, fields, sandboxes in which you are
playing. But your role, your goal, is to *transcend* and *master* those
energies, not to be mastered by *them*, not to wait for them to dictate to
*you* what choices you will make.

To come into this world and master this world means to embrace all of
the matrices, the fields of energy, that dance and play amongst
themselves and create the interwebbing of relationships we have spoken
of prior. And to learn of these things, to cultivate an awareness of how
they work, so that you can master and direct *them*, rather than the other
way around.

And ultimately, mastery is achieved when you have perfected the gifts
that are seemingly dictated by your chart. And then you transcend it
completely by resting into that Mind which forever transcends all
manifestation. For those that would use the language of the astrology,
the window of astrology, we would say to be very, very careful. Are you
looking to your intellectual understanding for the power you believe is
there and giving your power to that understanding? Or are you merely
allowing yourself to see certain patterns, to get a flavor for certain
possibilities, inclinations, so that you can bring awareness to them and
refine your mastery of them?

Dictate the effects of your astrological chart. Do not let the
astrological chart dictate the effects you experience.

*Question Two:* I recently saw a friend’s heart with my inner eye. And the
symbol was a beautiful Cross of Light. I would like you to elaborate on
the symbology of the cross.

*Answer:* Again, as we have shared many times, the cross symbolizes this:
The vertical axis symbolizes the union of Creator and Created, of
eternity descending into Creation or into time. The horizontal axis
represents the extension in both directions; that is, that which
embraces all of time — the past, the future. The horizontal plane is the
plane of the Earth, the plane of space and time, the plane of created
manifestation. The vertical axis represents, also, the pathway of
ascending or turning your attention away from the horizontal axis, in
order to access the guidance of the Comforter, the Mind of God, Herself.
And to bring that Light, to bring that vision, to bring that Truth, down
to the Heart where it can then be extended as far as from the east to
the west — to join eternity with the things of time. And, thereby, to
*transform* what has appeared to be the imprisoning of space and time.

As you would look, then, upon the friend and see this cross, it means,
then, that this one has begun to awaken to that consciousness; that it’s
not about living unconsciously, whereby the things on the horizontal
plane dictate your reactions and your choices. But rather, it is to
quietly go within, to receive vision and guidance, and then to learn how
to *translate* that into the horizontal plane.

This cross is also the symbol of the Christed Consciousness, which is
exactly That Mind that is committed and dedicated, not to escaping
creation into some formless abyss, but rather, to access the Mind of God
the Love of God, and to *descend* it, to bring it down into the mind —
into the human mind, the human body — in order to extend it, to create
in a different way ... not a fearful-based way, not a survival-based
way, but a way based on revelation and vision and the willingness to
receive the perfectly unlimited Thoughts of God, and then to extend
them.

You can begin to look upon anyone in that way. Simply tune into their
heart, which is their core or their essential vibrational pattern. And
simply ask,

> Well, Holy Spirit, is the Cross of Light awakened within them? And if
> so, to what degree?

And you will find that you can come to see it that quickly. And then
you’ll know who to spend your energy with and who not to. Not out of
judgment, but out of recognition that you can’t put the Cross there
yourself. You can only learn to recognize where it has awakened in
others. And those are the beings you want to, shall we say, dance with
as brothers and sisters upon this plane. Does that make sense for you?

*Response*: Yes.

*Question Three:* Can you talk about initiations, and passing through them, and,
then, having similar energies represent themselves again at a different
level of the spiral?

*Answer:* Beloved friend, you’ve already done all that needs to be said.
Initiations are those experiences which you cannot formally set up ahead
of time. You can have the commitment, the intention, the dedication to
awakening and healing and birthing Christ. Then you let the Holy Spirit
take care of the details. Those details become, at times, *windows,
doorways, initiations*.

To use a very simple example, imagine one who is sitting at the feet of
a master learning the grand art of deep meditation. Then, one day the
master says,

> Oh, by the way, I need you to fly from the Himalayas to New York City to
> delivery a letter. Would you mind doing that?

No problem.

And the student takes the letter and gets on the plane — after spending
sixteen years in the cave in the Himalayas — and goes to New York City.
*Initiation time*. Can that student draw on what he has learned to be at
peace in this new world? Hmm?

Now, it is very true that the process by which you let yourself awaken
to the reality that ascension is already over with, carries you through
the spiral of time and through dimensions and worlds. And so you will
often come back around to experience similar energies that you
experienced before. But now *you* are *different*. There is more of you that
can embrace those energies being presented to you. The initiation comes
in that because the old energies presenting themselves once had a
certain effect, the first thing that they will kick up in your
consciousness is the old effect, as a memory.

The *initiation* comes in this: Will you recognize that you are free to
choose *differently*, or will you let the *old* association, the *old* memory,
*dictate* your choice of perception and behavior? When the old memory, the
old reactive pattern, is that which dictates your choice, you have
failed your initiation. And when you fail a course, you must repeat it.

But when you look at it and say,

> Oh, there are those energies again. I used to be very judgmental here. I
> used to flee. This time, I’m going to stay. I’m going to breathe. I’m
> going to use this as an opportunity to teach only Love, to extend
> forgiveness, whatever the lesson may be. Because there’s more of me
> available, I am safe to turn and embrace what once defeated me.

Now, you may not break off the entire chunk. Or you may--you may be done
with it. And you’ll know that you’re done with it, because the next time
you come around in this spiral and the world presents to you that old
energy, you’ll see right through it. And there will be no reactive
pattern, whatsoever. You’ll merely look and say,

> Oh, yes. I’ve been there before. It’s boring to me now.

The new pattern will simply guide your way — the pattern of forgiveness,
the pattern of Love, the pattern of being at peace, no matter what the
world seems to be doing. If one is projecting on you, whereas before you
may have been in fear, then when you come around (you’ve succeeded in
your initiation), and one projects their things on you, you merely sit
and *see through* the delusion of consciousness that your brother on
sister is living in. And you see the Christ within them. And quietly,
you bless them, in order to bless yourself.

Initiations are what time is all about. Do you feel complete with that?.

*Response*: Uh-huh. Thank you. Done with questions.

*Jeshua*: Hmm! We will see. Remember, beloved friend, *there is a place
within you that already contains all answers*. The day will come when you
trust that *so much* that you’ll no longer even be interested in spending
the time to ask me. We speak of questions you would ask for yourself,
not as a service to others.

And so, with that, we’ll let your bodies have their “breaks,” and then
put them back together, and we will continue.

Amen.
