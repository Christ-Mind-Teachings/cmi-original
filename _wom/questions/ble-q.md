## Question One

<div markdown="1" class="well">
*Question:* <span class="person">Jeshua, as we enter this very profound time of year, is
there anything that you would recommend that we hold in our
hearts?</span>
</div>

*Answer*: A request for winning lottery numbers would be nice.  

[Laughter]

Beloved friend, you asked a question that must be filled with levity, so therefore I
answered the question with levity.

For listen well to your words: “as we enter this profound time of year.” What makes it
any more profound than any other time of year? There’s nothing special about your
month of December. There are symbols written in the stars that indicate a process of
consciousness that’s going on in you all the time.

Therefore, rather than ask what should we hold in our hearts now as we enter this
profound time of year, ask what you can hold in your mind to create the profundity
in every moment of your experience, until there’s no difference between any day of the
year &ndash; so that every day is the Mass of Christ.

Hm. Got you!

[Laughter]

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Always, always! But it makes a lot of room for other people to ask their questions.
</div> 

A profound sacrifice you have made.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Thank you. I love being your bull’s eye.
</div> 

So does that answer help with you question?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yes it does, of course. Thank you.
</div> 

You see, the tendency of the mind that has become enamored with the thinking of
the world will carry the egoic pattern of wanting to shift its frequency by making
something more special than something else, even a time frame. And that attempt to
create specialness is the attempt to create inequality. And inequality, as you obviously
know, is the opposite of equality. If you seek unity, give up the need for specialness.
Therefore, this Christmas season, ask not what you can do to bring a profound
experience to this time, but reflect on what you must be doing in your consciousness
the rest of the year to not experience the profound mystery of life.

That’s a very good question. I wonder where it came from?

[Laughter]

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
The One of us, yes?
</div> 

Indeed.

So the one of us on this side of the horse race window asked a question, and the one
of us on the other side with the green visor (Hmm… I never did like the crown of
thorns, I changed it for a green visor) simply raced about and plucked the answer out
of the Heart that we all share and has given it to ourselves.

[Laughter]

[Inaudible, audience member speaking]

There are two forms of busyness. One is based in fear, the other is based in Love.
Which energy is fueling your busyness? For the one generates the extension of the
Kingdom, and the other denies it. Hmm.

Hmm. I believe we have done well with that one. So, any more questions?

## Question Two

<div markdown="1" class="well">
*Question:* <span class="person">In regard to the land we call Shanti Christo, there are
many friends coming to this area to participate, and many of us have in
our hearts the desire to live more closely to each other, in sharing our
growth processes, our loving each other, our understanding of your
teachings, and so on. There seem to be many unanswered questions and
desires of people who want to come together more closely, quickly, and I
wondered if you would address this?</span>
</div>

*Anwser*: Beloved friend, unanswered questions are always a form of doubt. Unanswered
questions reflect the quality of mind birthed not in God but in the world. The attempt
to hope that someone else will create the energies necessary in the third dimension to
allow you (not necessarily ‘you’ but the general you) to get what it thinks it needs,
closer proximity to other bodies in space, yet being in denial of stepping into the role
of what you might call leadership to bring that about. Therefore, understand well,
there are many that are being called, and some seem to have answered that call a little
sooner than others.

The call to Shanti Christo is the call to awaken first from every obstacle to the presence
of Power and Love and Light within their being. To no longer tolerate anything in
your consciousness that creates the barriers to the manifestation of the vision that
seems to be calling you, and the willingness to take complete responsibility for being
the one that manifests it.

For you see, that vibration is a very refined vibration. There is no room for
gamesmanship. There is no room for riding on the energies of others. There is no
room for denying the power of Christ within yourself. This level of purity is absolutely
necessary to bring forth in the field of time, patiently, with quality, the vibrational field
into which even more can be called, who will experience what you call spontaneous
healings of mind, emotion and body.

For if you would view that which is a communion or a coming together of souls
in the third dimension, and some are relying on others to carry the frequency, you
have inequality; you have conflict; you have dissonance. Dissonance weakens the
field of energy and the note that would come through the instrument does not carry
the power you would wish to behold. That, then, creates resentment in the minds
of those who are wanting others to really take responsibility, and resentment simply
creates in&ndash;fighting and death. Therefore, mark these words well: Shanti Christo is the
responsibility of everyone who genuinely feels called to its manifestation. Pure and
simple. For it is a grand experiment to bring forth the unified field, which is the Christ
Mind.

Does that make sense to you?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yes it does.
</div> 

Therefore, where there is impatience or unanswered questions, help those with that
type of energy to remember that they are already looking outside of themselves. They
need to come back to right where they are in the moment, and allow the process of
purification of their own consciousness through forgiveness, through accepting the
great power you hold to take care of anything you think looks like a problem around
you, or a limitation or a lack &ndash;&ndash; and to handle that first. That is, to seek the Kingdom
first, from which all things can be added.

That was a rather good question. And, again, we must ponder its source.

## Question Three

<div markdown="1" class="well">
*Question:* <span class="person">Jeshua, I’m reminded of our conversation about
co&ndash;creating Christs a few months ago, and I wonder if you
would extend that conversation somewhat tonight?</span>
</div>

Yes. Get &ndash; on &ndash; with &ndash; it.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Think you could make that any clearer?
</div> 

[Laughter]

No.

[Loud laughter]

All that you need is given, right here, right now. All power under Heaven and Earth
resides within the depth of your consciousness, which is that which literally is creating
what you see around you and what you feel within you. Therefore, claim that power,
own it, take it into your being, and never, never again allow yourself to deny that you
are the One, the One Creation of God. And unto you nothing is impossible. Does that
help clarify?

[Laughing] You’re wonderful!

I am only yourself. Hmm.

## Question Four

So, James, you have no question?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yeah, I have a question. I’m not sure. Okay, I’ll ask.

This one used to always want to take me aside and ask privately&hellip;

Okay, I’m wanting to ask about this 12/12 stuff. So I’ve already listened to all these other questions,
you see, and then I decide what’s the point of asking any questions? The answer is already given.
</div> 

So what’s the answer?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
So I’m still curious, that “there’s nothing special.” I understand that, and yet the mind in me goes,
there’s this dimension that we operate on and many other dimensions, and energy coming forth in
waves&hellip;
</div> 

From where?

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
From within us.
</div> 

And so then, what is this 12/12? Speak from the Truth that is within the depth of
your being.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
The desire for freedom to be made manifest upon the planet, that’s coming forth, pouring forth, from
a lot of our hearts.
</div> 

From the One Heart. Indeed, beloved brother, beloved friend, well have you
spoken &ndash;&ndash; for in truth, that which is being called 12/12 symbolizes an expression of the
desire of the One Mind to awaken from its dream. And have we not said that there are
four Keys to the Kingdom? And is not the first Desire? Therefore, you see, you did get
it, right from the very core of the deepest Truth. It is an expression of the desire of the
Mind of Christ to give up the dream of the dreamer. So, you see, you knew after all.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Mmmm.
</div> 

Beloved friend, there is only a small trace left of the deep pattern or tendency you’ve
been dissolving through many lifetimes &ndash; the pattern and tendency not to trust
yourself. And that, then, causes the mind to project onto others a better connection
with God than your own. Always have I loved you, and always shall I. And the day
comes quickly when you will look through the eyes of your heart upon me, and no
longer see me as above you. You will see in me the shining radiance of your perfect
equality with me. And then, indeed, the dance can begin.

<div markdown="1" class="well person">
Yay. Yay!
</div> 

Yet another timely question. So, how are you all doing?

These (what you call) gatherings of the family will now commence; and will grow.
And remember &ndash;&ndash; with patience, without doubt, trusting and allowing the perfect
unfoldment. And if you think it’s not unfolding perfectly, don’t look outside
yourself &ndash;&ndash; go back to the question:

> Did I love myself today? How many times did I express forgiveness to the world? Am I,
> pardon the vernacular, cleaning up my own act?

Because remember, this world is nothing more than a grand act.

So, with that, we can bring this time to a close. For what was needed to be shared has
been shared; and the questions asked are the questions also, not necessarily the same
words but the same essence, that are carried in many of your brothers and sisters. And,
therefore, accept my blessings as my equal. Please take the cloak from my shoulders
and the crown from my head, and adorn yourself. And, then, go and do likewise for
your brother and your sister.

Be you therefore at peace in this moment and always. Be you therefore the Light that
lights this world in simplicity and grace and a gentle smile. Be you therefore awakened
in this moment to the Truth of your only Reality. Be you therefore of good courage,
for I have overcome the world, and in that moment so did you. If it is completed in
me, it must be completed in you because there is only One of us here. Can you, then,
accept that you’ve already faced Crucifixion? You don’t have to repeat the process.
Can you accept that the Ascension is already done? Can you be &ndash;&ndash; will you be–the
embodiment of the Truth that sets all things free? Can there be any other use of time?

Blessings then be upon the One who shines brightly forever in the Mind of God, who
has created us we know not when or how. And that truth is inescapable.

My love to each and every one of you, for in you I see the reflection of myself and
know the Grandeur and the Radiance and Beauty and Love that my Father is. And I
praise my Father without ceasing.

Amen.
