# The Way of Mastery

The core teaching of *The Way of Mastery* was given by [ Jeshua
](/wom/jeshua/) through [ Jayem ](/wom/jayem/) over a three year period
of monthly sessions. Transcripts of each session are available here
organized by year.

- [ Year One: *The Way of the Heart* ](/wom/intro/woh/)
- [ Year Two: *The Way of Transformation* ](/wom/intro/wot/)
- [ Year Three: *The Way of Knowning* ](/wom/intro/wok/)

The [ *Early Years* ](/wom/intro/early/) are a collection of messages
given before the core teachings of The Way of Mastery.

[ *Answers* ](/wom/intro/questions/) to questions asked of Jeshua
throughout all the Way of Mastery material are compiled and available
here.
