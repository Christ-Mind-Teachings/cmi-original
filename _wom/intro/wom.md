# The Way of Mastery

The *Way of Mastery* was birthed from the relationship between Jeshua
(Jesus) and Jayem beginning in 1987. The *Way of Mastery* pathway
consists of five core texts and living practices. The core texts are available
here and include:

- [*The Jeshua Letters*](/wom/intro/tjl/)

    Jayem's account of his first meetings with Jeshua and the beautiful
    introduction to the pathway of awakening revealed in their
    conversation.

- [*The Way of the Servant*](/wom/intro/wos/)

    A poetic description of the journey of awakening taken from
    inception to recognition of self as the servant - one who walks this
    world awake.

- The core teaching - a compilation of a three year period of monthly messages.
    - [ Year One: *The Way of the Heart* ](/wom/intro/woh/)
    - [ Year Two: *The Way of Transformation* ](/wom/intro/wot/)
    - [ Year Three: *The Way of Knowing* ](/wom/intro/wok/)

Also available is:

- [*The Early Years*](/wom/intro/early/): a collection of messages
  given before The Way of the Heart.
- [*Q&A*](/wom/intro/questions/): asked of Jeshua after more formal
  sessions.
