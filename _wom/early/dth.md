title: Death and Earth Changes
---

Now, we begin.

And indeed, greetings unto you, beloved and holy friends. I come forth
to abide with you from a place that is not apart from where you are. I
come forth to abide with you because I love you. I come forth to abide
with you because you are already all that I am and all that I could
possibly represent to the mind of mankind. I come forth as a promise
kept that I am, indeed, with you always. I come forward because the time
comes quickly. And I come forth to gather my friends to myself who have
already chosen to join with me in this age, to bring forth that of the
Christed Consciousness from the depth of their own being; to walk this
earth as the arisen Christ; to be that one through whom the Love of God
is extended unto the plants and to the animals, and to every brother and
sister that walks with you and yet carries the veil of fear; that walks
the light, the temple of their heart. I come forth because I am asked to
come forth of my Father.

I am in charge of the Atonement. That is, I am in charge of the process
whereby this planet, this human consciousness, this third-dimensional
realm, will begin to move toward a transition of vibrational frequency.
Hm? Therefore, I come forth to any mind that prepares a place for me by
choosing to relinquish the burden of trying to be conformed to a thought
system, to a way of life that does not work â€&rdquo; a way of life and a
thought system that must be reversed completely, so that the heart leads
and the mind follows; so vision is the guide, and the body is used only
to bring forth into manifest form that seed of holy vision which the
Father would place within you.

I come forth because we are one. I come forth because we are friends. I
come forth for the simple joy of abiding with you, the Holy Children of
God. For from the beginning, which is before space and time, already
were we together as One Mind.  And in an ancient moment, a useless dream
was dreamt, a dream of forgetting, a dream of separation. But even in
that moment, already did your Creator, the one that I have called Abba,
Father, set the bridge in place that would one day become activated in
the depth of your soul, by which you would come from the world of your
making into the truth of the Kingdom . . . that the very words I once
explained to the world would become your words, that would become your
truth, your reality, your remembrance . . . that after all dreams have
been dreamt and the soul chooses to cross the bridge, it rests and
reclines in the simple truth that I and my Father are one. And we create
together only the good, the holy, and the beautiful.

Therefore, indeed, beloved friends, it is an honor and a joy to abide
with you, to co-create with you, to walk with you on the way that
youâ€™ve chosen. For it is only through the innocence of a perfectly
free will that the soul can return to the Kingdom.  Love does not need
to strive, Love does not need to reach out and hold onto, Love does not
need to persuade. It merely abides in its own nature, waiting for the
seeker

                                                                                        1
Jeshua ~ The Early Years

of reality to turn from the roar and din of the world, in which peace
cannot be found, in which fulfillment is forever lacking, and begins to
hear the crystal-clear but very quiet song of the Creator, whispering
eternally,

    Beloved child, I love you. Come, remember me, and let us be as One.

So, with all of that by way of greeting, I give thanks unto you, each of
you, for your willingness to hear the call and to answer it, to step
upon the bridge and allow its light, its intelligence â€&rdquo; for the bridge
is but the Holy Spirit, the link back to the Mind of God â€&rdquo; to guide
you in all things. And as you learn not to hear the thoughts born of the
world, but to hear the whispers of Spirit that arise from a quiet mind
and a peaceful heart and a decision to trust the voice for Spirit, you
cannot fail but to complete this journey. The end, therefore, is
certain, and each of you in your own way â€&rdquo; and indeed, all of you
collectively â€&rdquo; are witnessing and experiencing within yourselves and
in your relationships, the manner in which the Father, God, is calling
creation back to Herself.

Therefore, rejoice with one another. Be glad with one another. Celebrate
one another.  Love you, one another. For the end was written in the
stars before the stars were birthed. And that time comes quickly. For
long have I waited this age to be upon this plane, when enough momentum
has been created in the consciousness of mankind so that a wave of
awakening can no longer be shut out, that a wave of awakening can no
longer be resisted, that a wave of awakening will melt away all fear . .
. and once again the Kingdom of Heaven will be spread across the face of
this Earth. But unlike the time when Man recognized it not, mankind will
know that the truth is true, always â€&rdquo; and that what is real cannot be
threatened, and only what is real exists.

There, indeed, will come a moment when all dreams of fear are forgotten,
when all strife and enmity between brothers and sisters is dissolved as
but an echo of a thought â€&rdquo; thought so long ago that itâ€™s hardly even
imaginable. The Earth will radiate the light of Truth yet again, as she,
too, prepares to make her transition, her ascension, her vibrational
change; and the waters of this planet will run clearly, and the skies
will radiate with colors that have not yet been seen by human eyes.
There will be a harmony between all species and mankind. And the way of
the world will be forgotten. And the way of peace restored. And the
Earth will provide all that mankind could possibly need, simply by the
asking.

And in that day and hour when all things have been set in place and the
Atonement, the correction, has occurred, for a brief moment that state
will be experienced. And then [snaps fingers] this whole plane of
density will simply dissolve from view. Not gone, but translated into an
entirely new domain.



2 Death and Earth Changes

There are many â€&rdquo; indeed, we would say unto you that everyone living on
your planet at this time is being pressed to make the decision: Are you
going to stay and go for the ride? Or are you going to have to move to a
different neighborhood? Everyone is being confronted by that decision,
from the oldest to the youngest, even the brand- new, newborn child. By
the way, many of those that are being new born have already made the
decision, and thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re being birthed â€&rdquo; to assist in
setting the frequency. Many of the children being birthed in the world
now are already light years ahead of where humanity has been stuck for a
while. And they bring a new frequency of consciousness; they bring a new
sense of unlimitedness. And they will not settle for the limited
fear-based ideas that have created the world into which you were
birthed.

Each and every one has a role to play, a part that has been assigned. It
has been with you since the moment your soul was birthed; and the hour
and the day comes when each must turn within and finally allow that part
to flower and be played through them.  And in whatever way that you come
to it, you will understand the words that I spoke, seemingly so long
ago, when I was confronted with the finality of my drama, the finality
of my own teaching â€&rdquo; what some would the Crucifixion (Iâ€™ve never
desired to emphasize that part of it; that was just stepping-stones to
the Resurrection.) And those words are simply this: Nevertheless, not my
will, not the will of the separate fearful ego, but Thine be done â€&rdquo;
the will of the One Mind that is but Love. And when Love guides the way,
miracles sprout before you. And not one obstacle is left in front of
you; it dissolves before you reach it.

So . . . here you are. In a little building in what you call your Santa
Fe, gathering with brothers and sisters that you have known across space
and time, because youâ€™ve all answered the same call and are beginning
to be called into a resonance that accelerates the growth of all of you.
Just as many are being called together through different lineages,
through different teachers â€&rdquo; orchestrated, if you will, to gather
together in their own ways, to learn the lessons they yet need to learn,
to discover their way of service to the planet, to humanity, to the
Kosmos, to the Heart of Christ and to the Creator. An ancient dream
begins now to end. The circle is nearly completed, and the pendulum
returns all things to the pristine and innocent truth that all things
are but the extension of the radiance of Godâ€™s presence. And fear can
have no place in a mind that has awakened to the reality of God.

And what you are doing here, even in this evening, is a part of that
very process. Iâ€™ve said many times that I come to call my friends to
myself. Imagine that all of you have been given a script very, very long
ago. And part of the script said that the day would arise when you would
reconnect with an old friend â€&rdquo; the one the world has called Jesus. And
that through that connection a vibration would be created that would
accelerate the fulfillment of your own part, your own unique role to
play, the stepping



                                                                                        3
Jeshua ~ The Early Years

into the fullness of your Christed nature â€&rdquo; just as once, as a man, I
decided to take my Fatherâ€™s word at face value and stepped into my own
Christed nature.

And while many beings sit before their televisions in this town of yours
tonight and many more sit in what you call the rooms for
unconsciousness, putting the liquid in the body (the bars), while many
seek a lover to keep them warm through the night, the night never lasts
forever. You have chosen to come here because you have heard an
invitation for this one evening, and you have accepted. Therefore,
celebrate and rejoice, for the day is at hand and there is no greater
joy than the re-communion of ancient friends who, deep within
themselves, know that the time is now. The dance has begun, the music
has started . . . Hmmm . . . And the whole of creation will come to this
party.

So. We want, then, in this evening to speak specifically to certain
questions that have been generated, for they hold a purpose in helping
to extend and to clarify a simple message about this time frame, about
certain changes, about certain things that are now occurring within your
governments, upon your planet, as this Armageddon boils to a crescendo
in which all souls are being asked,

    Well, are you going to join the dance, or are you going to have to
leave the neighborhood?

That is not a judgment, it is an offering being made to the soul of
everyone: Use time constructively, you can heal your heart, you can
practice forgiveness, you can awaken as Christ. Youâ€™re going to have
to, because the planet is doing the same thing; and if you donâ€™t come
with her you wonâ€™t be able to handle her light and her frequency, and
youâ€™ll need to move to a different neighborhood. Thatâ€™s all. No
judgment, no fear, no being struck dead by God â€&rdquo; only a simple
offering. You can awaken now, or you can awaken somewhere else, later.
There have been far too many â€œlatersâ€.

So. We believe, then, that you have questions.

Well, Jeshua, itâ€™s not terribly fair for you to answer the questions
before I pose them.

Itâ€™s just a simple mistake that we occasionally make.

There seems to be a polarization going on now between people who are
answering the call and people who would remain in fear. And those things
look like wars and fights and racial tension. Is this part of that
process?

No, itâ€™s because of what has been placed in the water.

[Laughter] Iâ€™m glad you havenâ€™t lost your sense of humor.


4 Death and Earth Changes

Indeed. Too much of what you call your fast food.

[Laughter]

Beloved friend, you have heard it said that when you hear of wars and
rumors of wars â€&rdquo; no, the time is not quite yet but, boy, is it getting
close. Hmm? Indeed. As we spoke a moment ago â€&rdquo; and please understand
this â€&rdquo; there is no such thing as punishment.  There is no condemnation
or judgment in the mind of God, who is above, and seeks to give his Holy
Child all good things, and would lead the child from dreams of strife
and suffering and fear to dreams of freedom and peace and empowerment
and Christedness. There is a vibration beginning to build in the depth
of this dimension, this density you call your third â€&rdquo; third dimension,
third-dimensional reality. Although we would say, thereâ€™s no reality
here yet, but itâ€™s coming.

[Laughter]

This vibration is like a pebble dropped in a pond that is beginning to
send ripples. Itâ€™s been going on for some time, itâ€™s beginning to
pick up pace, beginning to vibrate a little more, like water beginning
to boil. You sense that itâ€™s happening, although you donâ€™t even see
the bubbles rising yet. You know somethingâ€™s changing in the energy of
the water. And as that occurs, it is literally rippling through every
soul. Why?  Because separation does not exist. And if God holds the
thought,

    Okay, time to nudge the child. Iâ€™ve let them dream long enough.
Letâ€™s see if they can hear my voice over their dreams,

that ripple must go through every created soul. And as it does so, it is
stirring up all the old fears, all the old patterns, all the old habits,
and the soul is being asked,

    Are you ready to purify?

which simply means to make a different choice. Itâ€™s not . . . it
doesnâ€™t require lying on a bed of nails. Hmm? Simply the recognition
that somethingâ€™s coming up that no longer feels as comfortable as it
once did. Are you willing to let go and allow a small period of
disorientation until reality settles in? And what you thought could have
never been, becomes your norm. And you walk the world awake.

There are many who are having their fears escalate. And why? Because
they are committed to fear. They believe in fear; it is what keeps them
safe. I know that sounds odd, but itâ€™s very true. As long as I can
look out upon my neighbor and see you as the bad person, then I know who
needs to be attacked. And all we have left to do is figure out how to
attack you before you attack me. Very simple. And if I win, I get


                                                                                            5
Jeshua ~ The Early Years

all the marbles. But in attack, no one can win. For when the attacker
attacks, the attacker is attacked by the weight of the negativity of
their own fear.

So, yes, what youâ€™re seeing on the planet is a polarization that is
occurring because every soul is being confronted by the decision to heal
and to forgive; or to hold onto the idols of their woundedness and to
judge.

Once I said, â€œWith what judgment that you put out, rest assured you
will be judged in the same way.â€ Why? Because you create your
experience. So again, there will be many who will not be able to live on
this planet. That is why there is also a creation of many odd and new
dis-eases upon your plane. It is why there are very bizarre things being
done by certain governments on your planet as the fear builds â€&rdquo; in an
attempt to remain in control of something that they donâ€™t even
understand. And yet, none of it can affect the pure in heart, the meek
who will inherit the Earth, those that choose to heal the gap in their
own being between themselves and the mind of God. For they will be led
in each moment. And nothing will befall them. A few lessons on the way,
yes, but only by way of purification, only by way of a deeper wisdom, a
deeper understanding. Where you extend to your Father a smidgen of
willingness, the end is certain; and you are safe to trust what you feel
in the depth of your heart, which is the temple of the soul, where
Father and Child rest together: God and Christ.

Does that help you in regard to that question?

Yes, thank you. But everything youâ€™ve said tonight can be taken either
physically or metaphorically. Is this a physical change that will occur
on the planet, or is this a metaphorical change and the planet itself
remain unscathed?

Beloved friend, I am very glad that you have posed your question in just
that way.  Now, we both know that to put anything into language in the
form of a question, you are forced to deal with the language structure
you have. Your language structure lives in duality. Things are either on
or off, white or black, theyâ€™re metaphor or theyâ€™re physical. But I
say unto you, the whole of this physical dimension is a metaphor. It is
a symbol of a vibration of thought. Does that make it less real? Not at
all. For how can the Holy Child of God create unreality? Therefore, this
dream will be played out and involve the whole of the created domain.
And yet itâ€™s still just a metaphor, part of a dream. For this house
you sit in, the town in which it resides, and the planet upon which this
town resides all exist in a space no wider than the tip of a pin. And
yet, where you abide, all of creation is contained within you, and you
are vast beyond the reach of all solar systems. And when you get a feel
for that, you will, indeed, marvel.




6 Death and Earth Changes

Yes, it will occur, and it is inappropriate and inaccurate for anyone to
assume that this change is merely pictures or symbols, that it really
only occurs in something called the mind thatâ€™s somewhere tucked
inside a body and has nothing at all to do with the planet, with the
stars, with the comets, with the photon belts. â€˜Tis all one thing:
Mind creating. Therefore, for Mind to awaken, all of Mind awakens and
changes. Yes, it will involve the planet itself. I believe that should
help make it clear.

Then the role of Shanti Christo must also be clear in this process. Is
it a beacon?

Actually, beloved friend, we have merely beguiled you, and that which is
called Shanti Christo is a distractive mechanism, being created by the
Devil.

[Laughter]

Beloved friend, yes. Shanti Christo is an expression of a vibration of
thought, like a pebble dropped in a pond, that is created to manifest
specific vibrational patterns or ripples. It will be utilized by us to
attract many minds and many beings who can step through the portal into
awakened consciousness. There are many portals being created. And why do
there need to be many portals? Because there are many levels of
consciousness and there are many forms of experience that youâ€™ve all
created, everyone on the planet. I am not everyoneâ€™s teacher, even
though I am in charge of the Atonement. So, imagine that Iâ€™m merely
sitting behind a small little desk out in the meadow, and I pick up the,
what you call your cordless telephone. In this case itâ€™s even a
non-physical phone. And I will call another teacher, another being, and
say,

    You know, this one over there had a very good connection with you
back in Egypt four thousand years ago. Why donâ€™t you pop down and have
a little chat with them?

So there is an orchestration going on. There may seem to be many forms
of the universal curriculum, many teachers, many methodologies. And yet,
all of them are but portals through which the soul chooses to walk â€&rdquo;
to step from fear to love, from insanity to sanity, from dreams to
reality. Shanti Christo, then, is one such portal through which I
specifically can activate the call and create a gathering place, if you
will â€&rdquo; a gathering frequency â€&rdquo; through which I can call those to
myself who, because of past resonances, past experiences, have come to
love me and have come to trust me as one who can carry them over the
bridge. Hm?

Yes, Shanti Christo has a role to play, and rest assured there is a
safety mechanism built into this vibration. This vibration cannot be
manipulated or used for personal gain. It cannot be misdirected, for the
mind that may be attracted to it and then sort of bounces off and goes
to the left or right is one that merely realizes that this vibration
requires (what is your phrase?) the â€œgetting realâ€. This is a
vibration and a portal that


                                                                                        7
Jeshua ~ The Early Years

helps souls step into the next vibration. You canâ€™t sneak anything
past the ego- detector. Hmm.

Does that help in regard to that question?

Yes.

Are there any other questions in the group about Earth changes?

Yes. Are we going to experience a period of three days of darkness
during this change upon the earth?

We would suggest here that it is very probable that this will occur. And
yet, it will be a little longer than three days. This will eventuate, if
it is necessary for the change of vibration, to require what would be
called the changing of the axis of the planet. This will create a bit of
a shake-up, as one can imagine, and there will be created a
blackening-out, and the sunâ€™s rays will not touch the Earth. This sun
itself is going nowhere.

Yes, but listen well to what I say, for there are many prophecies coming
out, and there will be many more as we move closer and closer. Many are
getting pictures that are the effect of the generation in their own
minds of how they need to understand the ripples that are coming to
them. We speak of probabilities because it is never certain what must
eventuate for a change of vibration to occur. And you can liken this to
your own lives. Sometimes you need to be hit with a broom handle to get
your attention. At other times, a quiet whisper seems to be enough.

We would suggest that, because there is no separation, the more that
souls choose to awaken and to heal, the less the need for shocking
circumstances to get their attention.  The more mankind awakens, the
easier the transition of the Earth. Does that make sense for you?

Yes.

Is there truly any difference between entities that describe themselves
as Germaine, Jeshua, Michael, and who would bring their message through
an individual? Is there really any difference among the messengers?

The answer is a resounding yes. And why? When you speak of difference,
what you are alluding to is that is there an entity that is its own
unique sphere of consciousness arising out of the One Mind. God is aware
of God because of Godâ€™s creation. You are Godâ€™s creation. Therefore,
the Father knows Himself because you exist to be aware of Him.
Individuation, like the ripple arising out of the ocean, does not change
the


8 Death and Earth Changes

substance â€&rdquo; itâ€™s still all made of one thing â€&rdquo; and yet, there is
individuation, uniqueness, just as there are several souls associated
with the bodies that have gathered in this room, and you all have your
own unique, cosmic social security number.

[Laughter]

Will it be bankrupt when we get there?

No, it is always, shall we say, overflowing. And you donâ€™t even have
to pay into it!

So, understand, then, that when we speak of One Mind, we are not saying
that individuality does not exist. Weâ€™re merely saying that each
being, each created being, has within them the power to operate from the
One Mind that I have called Christed Consciousness. It can go by many
names. And yet, individuation is eternal. There will never be a time, a
moment, or a non-moment, when all of you simply dissolve into some
amorphous blob of awareness. In other words, the more you settle into
God, the more the desire there is to individuate, so that you can have
relationship in which to celebrate the good, the holy, and the beautiful
â€&rdquo; to dance, eternally at play in the Fatherâ€™s Kingdom.

Does that help in that regard?

Most definitely.

Now, by the way, I would highly suggest that I would never listen to the
Germaine fellow. And Michael sometimes is a littleâ€¦ Hmmm. Just
kidding, of course.

And Mary shops at K-Mart.

Mmmâ€¦ Iâ€™ve never been able to keep that one under control. Rest
assured, we delight with one another, we play with one another, we see
the Creator, we see the presence of God as each of us, and we respect
our individuation, just as you respect yours. To see the oneness in
diversity, to experience communion between two wholes â€&rdquo; that is the
great promise of the Kingdom. To be in holy relationship in which two
Christs, as individuated beings, yet emerging from and operating from
the same mind, the same values, the same love, the same compassion, the
same wisdom, the same unlimited power to create the good, the holy, and
the beautiful . . . Now that is a dance worth attending.

Therefore, seek not the death of the self, but seek the arisen Self. Hm?
That should help.



                                                                                         9
Jeshua ~ The Early Years

Would you care to summarize this evening?

It has been&hellip; worthwhile. Beloved friend, as you well know, since the
thought was dropped in the mind, that this short gathering of this
evening was designed to bring forth some specific corrections that will
be flowing out to many minds â€&rdquo; many more minds than youâ€™re even
aware of. For those first ones who receive it will be struck, a little
chord is struck,

     Oh, yes, thatâ€™s right. Thank you for the nudge. I have to get on
with it. I have to get on with it. I was beginning to fall into the hope
that I could just dissolve away and not have to birth Christ.

And then they will give that to many others.

There is much being taught in your world that is not correct. Anything
based on fear is incorrect. Anything based on the end of creation, even
in positive terms, is incorrect.  For the Father extends himself
eternally. How, then, can there be an end to creation?  There is only
ever-expanding fullness â€&rdquo; fullness expanding into fullness, and into
fullness, and into fullness, and into fullness. Higher and higher, and
wider and wider, and brighter and brighter, and ever more blissful and
ever more wise and loving.

And you all know exactly what that means, for every consciousness
reciprocates or plays out the very journey of creation. You all know
that youâ€™ve made creations that were a little difficult, they were a
little crude; and so you sought new ways, didnâ€™t you? And you keep
birthing better and better creations. Guess what? Thatâ€™s it! Thatâ€™s
the power of God, which is the soul, seeking to create the good, the
holy, and the beautiful. And there reaches a point, of course, where you
realize that you have to give up being identified with egoic
consciousness, so that Spirit can truly use us all to create in a
Christed realm. Hm? Like leaving the things of childhood behind and
taking up your rightful place of a powerful, mature adult. To be an
adult in the Kingdom is to be Christ.

Therefore, indeed, beloved friends, allow the good, the holy, and the
beautiful to pour forth through your soul. For you are the ones sent in
this age, with all power under Heaven and Earth, to reveal to your
brothers and sisters the truth of a happy dream, the truth of perfect
freedom, the end of fear, and the remembrance of Love.

Be you, therefore, with one another often, and remember always that you
are the Light of this world. Why not get on with it? And with that,
peace unto you always, from the heart of one who loves you and has
reached across space and time to touch you and to whisper to you,

    Beloved friend, come, take my hand. We are on the bridge already.
Just step lightly. Come with me. I know the way.

From that one â€&rdquo; who is me, and speaking on behalf of the many who
gather with me each and every time this specific work is done â€&rdquo; I love
you and we love you. It is not possible for you to journey alone. And
what you are asked to do in the depth of your vision and in your heart,
rest assured, it would not be asked if you were not also given the power
and the support to bring it about. Never think you need to be the maker
and the doer. You need only be, as each of us is, a servant of the Mind
of the Creator who is but Love and whom we serve with perfect freedom
and joy and fulfillment.

Peace, then, be unto you always. Amen.

Jeshuaâ€¦Donâ€™t run off.

Where could I go?

Thank you. Take two.

Iâ€™d like to discuss with you, pursuant to the book that weâ€™re
working on, The Way Through Death, you brought to our attention this
past December that there were many individuals who died in the explosion
in Oklahoma City who were at that time unaware of their death situation.
They were somehow hung up in that moment of time of the explosion,
unable to extricate themselves from the collapsed building.  Weâ€™ve all
heard stories of ghosts still inhabiting the locations of their death.
Why is this so, if what Emmanuel says, that death is â€œlike taking off
a tight shoeâ€ is true?

Death is like taking off a tight shoe, but it does not, necessarily,
bring enlightenment and freedom. The tight shoe is the density of the
physical form. Yet, where a mind is not yet prepared, and where the mind
carries attachment to what that mind had learned to value â€&rdquo; other
bodies in space and time â€&rdquo; the energy of that soul cannot ascend to
the Father, to use an old Biblical term. There can be no ascension to
the Father, unless that soul has gotten over a very important hump: the
hump of at least having faith that there is something beyond this world.
Does that make sense for you?

So, in a very real way, a weight has been lifted. There is no cold,
there is no heat, there is no need for fuel for the body. Experiences
continue. The interesting thing is that without the physical density of
the body, there is no experience of time as you know it. Therefore, a
soul can remain stuck in a building that is collapsing for what you
would perceive as thousands of years â€&rdquo; if that mind remains attached
to the belief that it is only the third-dimensional physicality, and
that the only thing of value are other things of third-dimensional
physicality.

Just as, many times, you would walk down a street and not even notice
that a friend has passed you by because youâ€™re so fixated on where
youâ€™re going, the soul at death can be so fixated on its perceptual
values that it doesnâ€™t even notice angelic choirs singing in their
ear: â€œCome, beloved friend, ascend!â€ Doesnâ€™t even notice it,
until there is communication, till somehow there is discovered a way to
create or to bring its attention to value something else â€&rdquo; to realize
that something has profoundly changed, and that its belief system had
been limited.

Does that help you in regard to that question?

So, from what youâ€™re saying then, there is no set sequence that occurs
at that moment called death.  So a lot of people report on going through
the tunnel and youâ€™re there andâ€¦

That is a veryâ€¦ The tunnel experience being spoken of in your cultures
as the near- death experience is a very, very basic first stage of the
dying process. Primarily, it entails the withdrawal of energy from the
brain core â€&rdquo; from the brain core to the stem of the body or toward the
spine of the body. It creates the perception of the tunnel, in which
there is a withdrawal from the senses of the body into this, what
appears to be a tunnel. And it is a portal and a doorway. And yes, I
appear to many, and others appear, as well. But the belief system is
still functioning. That is only one of the first stages of the actual
death process.

As it continues, and as the brain core literally dies â€&rdquo; which simply
means that life force is withdrawn and not returned to it, so it is
dropped like old baggage â€&rdquo; then the soul, the consciousness,
experiences a vibrational leap, what you might call a quantum leap in
vibrational states, into more and more subtle states of its own being.
But there is a period in which there is a playing-out of the residual
effects of all of its perceptions and beliefs. It is called the . . . in
one stage, the life story is played back that fast. [Snaps fingers]
Thoughts or fears of a Satan or beliefs in a Savior become the energy
which attracts that experience to that individual.

So, in a general sense, there is something that occurs energetically.
But what occurs within that energy is entirely unique to each
individual. And what will matter is this: If time has been used
constructively â€&rdquo; that is, if you utilized time to let go of limiting
beliefs and begin to foster first faith and then direct experience in
tapping into other dimensions, into remembering the mind of God, if you
practiced forgiveness and healing â€&rdquo; then at death fear has no place to
grip the mind.

Yes, the tunnel begins to happen because the energy is being withdrawn
from the cellular structure of the body, from the brain itself toward
the brain stem â€&rdquo; what I call the stem or the interior of the spine.
And since the mind has been cultivating devotion to God, the willingness
to heal, the ability to let go without fear, then as these things


12 Death and Earth Changes

come up and move through very, very quickly, they have no effect
whatsoever, and the mind proceeds toward light â€&rdquo; greater and greater
dimensions of light. Hm? And it is possible for the soul, then, to
remain in those dimensions without any need of incarnating again. It is
always something left unhealed â€&rdquo; a fear, a self-judgment, a
resentment, an old anger â€&rdquo; that creates a heaviness that draws the
soul, using its infinite power, to re-create third-dimensional
physicality yet again, to try to get it right. It is always much wiser
to use the incarnation you have, to get it right! Donâ€™t think about
the old ones; donâ€™t think about the ones that might come. Realize that
right where you are, right where you are, everything is perfect for your
awakening.

You can awaken now, by choosing to teach only Love. And that must
include to yourself. To love the self is ultimately the final portal,
for only when you truly love yourself can you serve another. Only when
you love yourself so much youâ€™re no longer willing to tolerate
anything but the presence of Christ in you. When you believe that you
are so valuable that you should be treated like a priceless jewel. Then,
indeed, Christ will arise. For the Holy Son of God, who is but Christ,
will not come up and take his abode in a home unworthy of him. And what
is that home? Itâ€™s not the body; itâ€™s the Mind. Therefore, love
yourself.

When I once said, â€œLove your neighbor as yourself,â€ I thought it
was obvious that that meant you had to love yourself before you could
ever experience loving your neighbor. Therefore, to learn the way of
love, practice with diligence forgiveness.  Release expectation from
anyone or anything. Create your vertical alignment in the mind of God.
And seek not from the world what it does not possess: the eternal and
perfect peace that birthed you and that you are seeking to recover.
â€œBe you, therefore, whole and perfect,â€ means just that. Wake up.
Get it right while youâ€™re on the planet.  Let the mind heal. Choose to
be the presence of Love. Trust God above all things, and walk this world
as the meek who will inherit it. Be you, therefore, the presence of
Love.

And when the time comes, as it must, for that temporary density
structure called the body to dissolve and be given back to the Earth
from which it came, fear will have no place in you. And as the tunnel
begins to appear and you know â€&rdquo; this happens to every mind, by the way
â€&rdquo; there is a moment when you know something is occurring thatâ€™s
going to occur and youâ€™re not going to be able to interrupt it any
more; youâ€™re not going to be able to avoid the portal. When you
literally feel the energy withdraw from the cells of the body and move
toward the stem, or what you call the spinal column, you will welcome it
like a joyous ride. And you will turn your attention immediately upward
â€&rdquo; that is a metaphorical term â€&rdquo; but upward to the higher teachings
of the mind of God, rather than the teachings of a fearful world. And
you will let these things go like toys that have been outgrown. And then
the soul can ascend into its full remembrance.

                                                                                      13
Jeshua ~ The Early Years

â€œAnd in my Fatherâ€™s house are many mansions,â€ which means that
there are an infinite number of dimensions in which you can come to make
a new home, based on the quality of vibration that you have brought
yourself to in your understanding and in your consciousness, which is
nothing more than your love. But the only thing you can ever truly
regret is that perhaps you resisted giving that love away, even up to
the moment of death. And therefore, love freely, love abundantly, and
love without ceasing. And above all, love the Self that has been birthed
in the mind of God, for no other reason than to live in the
consciousness of God.

So, Iâ€™ll be the gnat shouting at the universe.

Is God self-aware, or is it simply a benign metaphysical force?

Benign metaphysical force.

Donâ€™t pick at it, just answer it.

There is nothing more benign than Love. There is nothing more
metaphysical, which mean beyond and permeating the physical, than God.
There is nothing more forceful, if you mean by that infinite power that
cannot be denied, than God. So if that is what you mean, I would say yes
to the use of those terms. Is God self-aware? Are you aware?

Hmm.

Hmm.

Hmm, hmm. Got it.

Hmm. It wonâ€™t be the last time.

[Laughter]

That, for me, begs the next question. Is there a force outside of God?

Just you. I well do understand the direction of your question. There can
be nothing outside of God, and what is unreal does not and cannot exist.
Yet, you have the power within the infinite freedom of God to believe a
perception that there is a force outside of or other than God. Just as
you have believed that you are separate from God. â€˜Tis is an optical
delusion of consciousness. It is a dream of a child sleeping in a
meadow, in whom no change has truly occurred. That which is called Satan
cannot exist or have any power, save in that mind that allows it, and
who gives that power to


14 Death and Earth Changes

it. For did I not ask you to speak unto one, could the devil withstand
your love? And did it not bring that one to silence? In other words,
Love heals â€&rdquo; because Love is real.  And when you step from fear into
Love, where did the boogeyman go?

Well, Iâ€™m through with my questions. If you have a summaryâ€¦

Could I ask a question?

Yes.

Getting back to Shanti Christo, could you give us an idea when this will
materialize?

Beloved friend, it already has. And in your third-dimensional plane of
time, you are witnessing the process whereby that materialization
occurs. In reality, it is already finished, because God does not think
thoughts that arise incomplete. Hm? You are merely tuning in to what has
already occurred. I know thatâ€™s a bit of a leap but itâ€™s okay, let
yourself take it. You are merely choosing to allow yourself to
participate in what youâ€™ve already done. For hear this: In reality,
the dream and the process of awakening never occurred. For what has no
effect has never happened. The dream, the awakening of the dream, is
already done. You might say you are watching the film. Film at 11:00.
Can you imagine a newscaster saying,

       Mmm. All of creation has awakened today and returned to the Holy
Mind of God. Film at 11:00.

[Laughter]

And what you are experiencing is the watching of the film. Like being
within a hologram. Yes, and when are the specific parts going to
manifest it and love you?  When would you like them to manifest?

Tomorrow.

Very well. Simply awaken tomorrow, and know: It is finished. Let no
doubt arise in your mind, and simply allow the Comforter, the Holy
Spirit, to reveal to you what has been finished. Imagine a&hellip; what you
call a supervisor at a construction site, building a beautiful building,
and you come by and you go,

       How did this happen?

And he puts his arm around you and says,



                                                                                        15
Jeshua ~ The Early Years

       Come. First Iâ€™ll show you the foundation, Iâ€™ll show you the
blueprint plansâ€¦

And yet, the whole time youâ€™re in the building and your mind begins to
tap in to the day they first brought the concrete to make the
foundation, then the steel girders, and then later the interior
decorators putting the final touches â€&rdquo; as he describes for you the
process whereby the very building in which you live was created. The
buildings on that land are already there. You just donâ€™t see them yet.
But theyâ€™re settling in, and you will see them. And when you see them,
you will know, just like hundreds of other beings will know,

       Iâ€™ve seen those before.

Not in another place and time, but because youâ€™ve already experienced
the completion.  Does that make sense?

Yes.

Indeed. And what can stand against the will of God? That is why those
that are called to add to and create this vibration must always rest in
certainty, in knowingness: It is finished. What a delightful way to
spend the last afternoon of the dream of separation.  Something to think
about.

Thanks, my friend.

Mmmm. Indeed. So, may I be allowed to leave this time?

Where could you go?

Exactly. I merely recede, and just call this communication process. And
by agreement always, I merely nod to my brother who no longer, no more
exists within the body than you exist within yours. Hm? Youâ€™re just
animating a temporary communication tool. I merely nod to him, and I
say, â€œWeâ€™re done now.â€ And usually he goes, â€œOh, so soon?
Thank you.â€ And he returns his attention to the body, as I release
my attention from it. Thatâ€™s all. Kind of like two friends, and one
night one of them sleeps in a certain bed in the house, and the next
night itâ€™s the other personâ€™s turn. We just slide in and out of the
bag of dust. Sometimes you never quite know whoâ€™s there.

Itâ€™s a chance to sleep around though, right?

Indeed. â€˜Tis good to choose loving cosmic bedfellows.


16 Death and Earth Changes

Indeed. Therefore, again â€&rdquo; and always â€&rdquo; I leave, yet I leave not
you, for I am closer to you than your own breath, and never further from
you than the width of a thought.

Think well, then, and remember the truth that is true always.

Amen.
