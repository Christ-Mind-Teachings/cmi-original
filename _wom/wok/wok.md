  <p>
    Jeshua's invitation to us is to wake up from every illusion that we
    have ever been separated from God, and to remember the deepest truth
    of who we really are: <em>Christ</em>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    <em>The Way of Knowing is that way in which you have knowledge by 
    direct experience, direct apprehension , by choosing to be only
    that&hellip;</em><br/><cite>~Jeshua</cite>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>The Way of Knowing</em> lessons, and original question and
    answer sessions, are the third year of 35 monthly lessons given by Jeshua
    during the years 1995-1997. Together they outline the steps and
    practices for awakening in Christ Mind.
