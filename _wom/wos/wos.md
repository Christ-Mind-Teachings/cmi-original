# FOREWARD
<p class="center">By Rev. Kay Hunter</p>

At each junction in my unfolding it would appear I have been given
exactly what I needed to see my God-self more clearly. The right
teacher, that perfect book, that certain relationship, that catalystic
event has appeared, each with but one single purpose: to assist me in
seeing the Light within.

As I have surrendered more and more to the call to minister to others, I
have given up my resistance to being ministered to in this life. An avid
student of truth principles, as taught through the Science of Mind, and
a devoted student/teacher of *A Course in Miracles*, I have always been
open to the revelations of God’s wisdom. I love to teach, for it is
through teaching that I have most definitely learned.

It was in a class setting that another level of personal awareness was
opened to me through a book. As the class discussed unconditional love,
and ways to live it daily, a student came forward and said to me: “Rev.
Kay, I received this book from Washington state yesterday. I believe it
answers some of our questions and I would like for you to read it.” The
book had an intriguing title: *The Jeshua Letters*.

Having loved Jesus since I was five and felt He was indeed my friend, I
felt an inner urge to open the book right then. As I flipped through the
pages I began to read aloud the wonderful thoughts formed on the pages.
The class’s response was immediate. “I want that book,” they said.

“Where can we get it?” As we looked in the back for ordering
information, a message caught our attention. It read: “Jeshua is
available to speak to your group. Also, private sessions with Jeshua are
possible, either in person, or by mail/phone.” Addresses and names were
quickly noted.

*I want to do that*, my inner self insisted. I set out to find the
location and phone number of this author/channel, Jon Marc Hammer (now,
Jayem), listed as living in the Tacoma, Washington area. Inside I knew
that another step in my unfolding into the Light awaited me.

The student was kind enough to give me his book, and *The Jeshua Letters*
became a very important teaching tool for me. Our church ordered case
after case of the books for our *Science of Mind* and *Course in Miracles*
students, who bought them as quickly as we received them. Eager minds
had sought the truth, and the truth had found us – as truth always does
when we are open to it.

One evening, as I was reading the book, I stopped to look at the
foreword. It was written by Alan Cohen, another author who had crossed
my path with a wonderful book: *The Dragon Doesn’t Live Here Anymore*.

*Alan Cohen and Jayem ... what a wonderful combination*, my heart mused.
Then I remembered, Alan Cohen was coming to my church to lecture in just
a few weeks. *I can find out from Alan how to get in touch with Jayem.
Thank you, God*, I thought, and I went on with my reading joyfully.

The weeks passed, and Alan Cohen arrived at Community Church in Dallas
to present his lecture/workshop. As the day progressed I promised myself
I would find the perfect time to ask him about Jayem and how to reach
him. Then-as only the universe understands such things-the phone rang. I
answered. The voice on the other end of the line said, “Hi, this is
Jayem. I am trying to reach Alan Cohen. His Hawaii office told me I
would find him here. May I speak to him please?” I found myself shouting
excitedly into the phone: “I can’t believe it’s you! I have your book
right here on my desk. I wanted to talk to you. I want a session with
Jeshua. Your book is wonderful. I want to order more of them. We can’t
keep them on the bookstore shelves. Wow, this is just great!”

As I look back on that conversation I feel certain that I must have
startled that gentle channel with my excitement, but I just couldn’t
contain myself. (I do want to say, by way of explanation, that I did put
Jayem through to Alan, but not before I had scheduled an appointment
with Jeshua and ordered another case of *The Jeshua Letters*.)

But the story was not yet complete. I began to receive copies of
transcriptions of some of the Jeshua sessions in Washington. I couldn’t
wait to get the message contained in them into the eager hands and minds
of the students and discussion groups formed to go over each detail of
the new material. What a joy!

Then came the gift of gifts. One of my students had gathered together a
small group of people who wanted to go to Washington to attend a Jeshua
session. “Would you like to join us, Rev. Kay?” he asked. “I would like
you to be my guest if you can come.”

Could I join them! I was so filled with excitement I don’t think I
really needed the plane to fly. The anticipation I felt at the thought
of meeting Jayem, and his angel-like wife Anastasia, was just the tip of
the iceberg of what I felt at the actual physical meeting. It was like
coming home, greeting old friends, and just knowing I was in the right
place at exactly the right time.

And when Jeshua came through Jayem, and that quiet, gentle essence
filled the room, each heart there felt the presence of unconditional
love. It was then I just knew that I had to find a way to bring this
wonderful message and messenger to Dallas and the students of truth
there.

A time was set, and the event became a reality. Over 400 people crowded
the auditorium to be with this author and the essence of divine
understanding that came through him.

Lives were touched! Lives were changed! And I knew I had moved into
another phase of personal awareness.

Now another book comes through this same beautiful channel, a book that
is just as touching and even more revealing. It walks us through our
doubts, our fears, our inner struggles; it dissolves the illusions and
leads us to the Light. The *Way of the Servant* has touched me even more
deeply than Jayem’s first book, if that is possible. It shows our
sensitivity to the intuitive, and our resistance to its guidance. It
gives us the answers to questions long pondered in the deepest recesses
of our mind. It inspires, comforts, and makes the truth more real than
our long-believed illusions.

Thank you, Jayem, for your courage, your willingness, your allowing.
Thank you for daring to walk your path with such clarity, that we-all of
us-might walk our own in greater awareness.

*Rev. Kay Hunter*

# PREFACE

It is August 8, 1990. Not far beyond a tiny town on the southwestern
coast of the island of Hawaii, a narrow road winds down from the highway
to a lovely little spot named Keokea. The coastline here is rugged.
Battered cliffs of reds and browns plunge from treeline to sea. There is
a jetty of sorts that runs from the end of the northernmost cliffs. A
crude pile of boulders, it creates a shallow lagoon just right for small
children to swim in. There is no white sand beach and, thank God, no
throng of tourists baking in the delicious Hawaiian sun.

Near the center of the park a stream meanders through the dense foliage.
Here I bathed yesterday, making my way far enough upstream to be out of
sight. I dipped my body into the cool waters, then sat on a rock,
allowing the warm caress of a gentle breeze to dry me, breathing deeply
the sweet fragrance of plumeria.

Here, in this magical spot that evokes memories of Eden from some
forgotten place of the soul, meditation comes easily. In no time at all,
I feel that familiar place, as though I have come to the eye of the
hurricane, “the stillpoint of the turning world.”

A familiar vibration; He is here. As though waiting for me to return
Home from a journey, He knocks gently, assuredly, on the door of my
heart. I answer, turning my attention to Him, and Him alone.

*It is time for us to begin our second work together. For this did I
suggest the notebook.* (He refers to a small red binder that I
impulsively threw into my shopping cart a few days ago.) *Use this solely
for our communications. The publication of The Jeshua Letters is now
imminent.* (A series of events, none of which I could have imagined,
would begin within a month that did, indeed, lead to the book’s
publication.)

*Again, I suggest that you continue in your learning of trust. It is not
important that you see how all things will be accomplished. Remember, to
the world the awakened mind seems naive, but the opinions of those who
believe what is Real, is not, and what is not Real, is, surely should
not be heeded.*

I am distracted. The mosquitoes have won. Sighing, I rise from the rock,
dress, and return to camp...

One of the reasons I love Hawaii so much is this moment. The sun has
long since set, replaced by a bright, full moon. It illuminates trees
and rocks and ocean waves, while painting cloud edges in silver-white,
and still it is warm! Warm enough to lay here undressed, drinking the
energies of this place deep into every cell.

As, again, I feel His presence within me, a thought of amazement arises
in my mind. He is continuing our conversation now as if there was no
break in our communication. This simple fact is a gentle reminder that
time is somehow not quite what I have learned it is. As He speaks, I see
it, the title:

<p class="center">__The Way of the Servant__</p>

<p class="center">*Living the Light of Christ*</p>

<p class="center">“For the first shall be last, and the last, first.”</p>

*This teaching was not intended for the use it has been given by those
who would find in me justification for the judgment of their brothers
and sisters. That which is called the sacred book of your Bible does, in
fact, contain many seeds of wisdom. However, these have often been
separated from their original contexts and woven into stories designed
to serve not the Holy Father, but the __conception__ of God the mind in
separation would long for.*

*I gave this teaching to those known as my disciples. Its meaning serves
as the theme of this present work, for when the mind is truly awakened
from the dream of separation and the soul is returned to its only
Reality as the Son of God, there comes then a new beginning. No longer
is there futile searching for what the world cannot offer or hope to
contain.*

*Abiding in that peace which forever passes understanding, the soul is at
rest. It neither desires the things of the world nor judges them. It
learns the sublime art of what has been called “waiting on the Lord.”
This merely means that the soul moves in accordance with the Father’s
will, and can no longer consider doing otherwise. The soul dons the
cloak of the servant.*

*The Way emerges for us: When the acknowledgment of your Reality as the
only begotten Son of God is accomplished and the Armageddon between this
Reality and the habit of useless dreams is ended, the journey to the
Kingdom is completed and the journey __within__ it begins. The whole of
Creation is reclaimed as __one’s own__, and the soul’s only desire is that
Creation be restored as a reflection of the holy thought of God, who is
but Love.*

*Love is a radiant splendor forever shining beyond all appearance, a
splendor held as a distant memory in the heart of all forms of Life, and
it is this that Life strains to rediscover. When this is accomplished,
the very purpose of Creation will be completed, and the things of Heaven
and Earth shall pass away, as mist before the rising sun.*

*In this work, I shall address the meaning of servantship, for here is
found the highest calling of the soul, as well as the final enactment
possible in the field of manifestation.*

*True servantship is not in any way possible while yet there lingers hope
for salvation in the things of the world, including those ideas of
salvation which cleverly conceal the fear that is ego; the dream of the
separate self that can gain, or lose.*

*I will clarify the true nature of the servant, as well as the qualities
of genuine service. We will journey through the field of obstacles which
peep the highest joy just beyond the grasp of the one who would join in
union with God.*

*Know this: Nothing ever imagined by the mind of man can bring the soul
such depth of peace, such breadth of fulfillment, such heights of
unspeakable joy as can servantship. Enlightenment, when fully realized,
gives birth to the servant as surely as does the flower burst forth from
the seed well planted and nurtured.*

*Contemplate deeply what is here being spoken, again and yet again, in
the quiet of solitude, for these words I have chosen deliberately.
Taking them deep into your heart will hasten your consummate awakening.*

*This work is given to assist those who will soon touch the heart of a
perfect Remembrance. It is a great truth that greater works than mine
shall you who serve Love bring forth into the world in these Last Days.*

*Herein is the introduction completed...*

After giving the introduction, He suggested I be patient because this
work would come into form at the appropriate time. He also asked that I
keep the little red notebook close at hand, and I agreed. I had no way
of knowing then that three years would pass before He would finish it!

The process of writing was actually quite simple. I dragged the notebook
with me wherever I went, lived my life, and waited. Sometimes, several
months would go by without so much as a mention of this work from Him.
At times He literally stopped in midsentence, only to pick it up later
as if there had been no interruption. Waking me at two or three in the
morning with that familiar little vibration in my heart continued to be
one of his apparently favorite times. Finally, I grew accustomed to the
fact that He might never finish it at all! I confess that my wife
occasionally enjoys telling friends how I threw the notebook across the
room when the words I was scribing pushed my buttons, or conveniently
left it on a friend’s table, “forgetting” what I had done with it.

In fact, when He dictated the final few pages and said “Amen,” it failed
to sink in that it was done. I got out of my chair to head to the
kitchen, suddenly stopped in my tracks, and muttered, “It’s done. No
more little red notebook!”

Alan Cohen, in his foreword to *The Jeshua Letters*, called Jeshua “a
masterful teacher.” Looking back, this one simple fact becomes
abundantly clear. *The Way of the Servant* is a link in an exquisite
tapestry being woven by this loving master, always dedicated to
awakening us all to the presence and reality of Love, beyond our fears
and hurts and angers and doubts.

*The Way of the Servant*, like a good painting, reveals its treasures to
you the longer you linger with it. It has pushed my deepest buttons,
showing me where my own ego games continue, requiring my attention. It
has become an everpresent reminder that He is with all of us always,
overflowing with the Love we are choosing to remember on this planet. We
offer it to you as it was offered to us. If you choose, it will become a
blessing on your journey, a constant companion righting your course
whenever, for a fleeting moment, you are tempted to be distracted by the
voice of the world that seems to have made a home in your mind. As this
gift from Jeshua has done for so many, may it also serve to turn your
ear to the gentle Voice that yet lives within us all, the Voice which
speaks only of Love, of what we are together, forever. Streams of joy!

</div>

<p class="tr_break top"><span class="dropcaps">S</span>*ervantship*\
It appears an odd word,\
yet within it lies the meaning of sacrifice,\
of Love,\
of true Being.</p>

Servantship is a *vocation*\
to which one is called,\
not by a God who exists apart from you,\
but by that one true God\
who abides eternally\
in the Heart of one’s heart,\
and is forever the Soul of one’s soul.

For the one true God\
is your only Reality,\
and in this does the recognition dawn\
that *you* -\
who would insist\
on the smallness of yourself\
as you have dreamt it to be -\
contain, in truth, all wisdom;\
that *you*\
contain all perfections\
holy men would so diligently seek\
and ignorant men would mistakenly seek\
in the destitution\
of their worldly dreams.

That one true God\
to whom you are eternally united,\
so that no boundary between you\
can be distinguished,\
is that which has sustained\
the infinite forms\
of your dreams,\
their incessant creation fueled\
by the one thought of separation.

And now,\
in the time of Recognition,\
after the allure of the dream has paled\
and finally lost all trace of significance,\
and in that perfect silence\
where the sleeping Son no longer rebels\
against the simple\
and loving\
embrace of the Holy Father,\
the light of the living Christ is rekindled.

As a flame in a windless place,\
its light grows ever brighter,\
dissolving all traces of the shadows\
which have kept it hidden,\
lighting up the dark places\
where the dust which is the world\
has settled,\
until even the dust is dissolved\
and becomes as Light itself.

The doer is undone.\
The maker of the world is unmade,\
and Christ again,\
lives.

Here,\
the end of all fruitless journeying.

Here,\
the ceasing of all strife.

Here,\
the realization of the only Truth,\
beyond all utterance,\
beyond the understanding of the world,\
beyond even the dream\
of the one who would seek God.

For the seeker is no more,\
as if he had never been,\
save as a fading memory of a dream\
dreamt long ago.

Returned to the embrace\
of our Holy Father,\
the one who has returned acknowledges:\
“I AM that One.”

*Christ lives, and Christ alone.*

As it is,\
has been,\
and forever shall be.

<div class="center">

</div>

<div class="cap">

The awakened Heart\
is likened unto one\
who has journeyed\
to the summit\
of the highest mountain.
</div>

Here,\
she looks out upon\
the distances traveled,\
the many landscapes\
stretching out below her,\
the seemingly infinite shapes and hues.

She beholds all the worlds of mankind,\
and sees them as empty,\
as a moment’s diversion,\
fragments of but one dream.

She beholds herself as the one dreamer,\
and she would that\
every vestige of herself\
be nudged from sleep to waking.

And now,\
the transformation is completed.

Resting in the Light of Remembrance,\
embraced eternally\
in the arms of his Father,\
the only begotten Son abides\
in the Kingdom\
prepared for him\
in that most ancient\
beginning before time is.

Her will has become\
as her Father’s.\
United again as one,\
the first movement of that Divine Will\
stirs in the vision before her.

Compassion arises\
for the whole of Creation\
and she sees without effort\
the task set before her:\
the awakening of the whole of herself,\
now recognized as every soul,\
every blade of grass,\
every wisp of breeze.

Awakened\
as the source of all things,\
existing in all things,\
the one Son,\
united with the Holy Father -\
the brief dream of the Prodigal Son\
vanquished -\
looks out upon himself\
with but one desire: Awaken!

Restored to her rightful place\
at the right hand of the Holy Father,\
purified of all distortions\
born of a moment’s dream, \
a movement begins.

Felt in the heart,\
it expands first upward,\
upward beyond the crown of the head,\
then outward,\
filling every cell\
of a body transfigured,\
brought evermore\
to the form of a vehicle\
that will serve only the fulfillment\
of her task.

And then,\
when the Father and the Son together\
have prepared\
the body and mind of Christ,\
the movement of Divine Will\
becomes *downward*,\
compelling the arisen Christ to step\
deliberately and without haste\
in the direction of all that now lies\
before Him,\
far below Him,\
spread as far as the eye can see,\
slumbering at the base\
of this great Mount Zion.

Now,\
her steps\
become more certain.

Now,\
his steps\
become ever lighter,\
unburdened from the weight\
of a self that never was,\
yet clamored for a food\
which never satisfied.

Now,\
her steps\
become ever more directed\
from a source perfectly trusted,\
and with each step,\
dissolving\
is any need to know\
where she goes,\
what she shall eat,\
or what she shall wear,\
for her Father knows\
she has need of these things.

He knows but one thing only:\
he goes as the wind,\
caring not the direction of his travels,\
remembering not\
the direction of his coming,\
abiding always\
in the Light of the Holy Father.

Behold!\
The servant is born.

<div class="center">
![line](Shared/images/line4.jpg)
</div>

<p class="center">*For the first shall be last,\
and the last, first.*</p>

The only begotten Son dreams.\
And in his dream is forgotten\
that which eternally\
he *is*.

And the first has become last,\
even as the creation\
of innumerable worlds arises,\
replacing the splendor\
of Remembrance\
with the lifeless,\
enchanting,\
ever-changing forms of mere illusions.

And the last has become as the first.

Yet,\
within the worlds\
of her dream\
lies the crystal clear gem\
of Reality,\
for the unspeakable Love\
which the Father is\
illuminates the dream of the Son,\
granting her perception\
of all that she would *choose* to perceive.

And the Father merely waits,\
abiding wholly in the purity of his Light,\
seeing naught but the splendor\
of his Son,\
waiting for the one who lays dreaming\
to awaken.

The first is, indeed,\
now last,\
and what must always be last -\
mere illusions cast by,\
and within,\
the mind of the Son -\
has become first:\
the Kingdom is forgotten.

Habituated\
to the play of shadows,\
no more than projections\
of his momentary thought,\
the Son suffers the worlds\
of his own making,\
reveling in transitory pleasures,\
enduring the pain of countless wounds;\
yet he continues on,\
proliferating the worlds of experience,\
seeking ever more desperately\
for what he has long forgotten,\
knowing not what it is he seeks,\
calling it by various names,\
striving endlessly\
to discover his salvation\
in the worlds he has made,\
insisting it be found there.

And the Father waits,\
abiding in the purity of his Light,\
seeing naught but the radiant splendor\
of his Son.

The maker of the world,\
but not of Reality,\
unknowingly remains impelled\
to experience again and yet again\
the fruit of pride:\
vanity of vanities.

Insisting on her chosen thought,\
enmeshed\
in a deepening web of shadow,\
yet she cries out desperately\
in the aloneness of her soul:

*“__I__ am,\
__I__ create,\
__My__ will be done!”*

And still,\
the Father waits,\
abiding in the purity of his Light,\
seeing naught but the radiant splendor\
of his beloved Son.

As the offspring of Light Divine\
wanders from world to world,\
ceaselessly moved to act,\
seeking\
without knowing he seeks,\
searching for the Kingdom\
without knowing he searches,\
creating and devouring the forms\
of his apparently endless dream,\
an impulse begins to grow.

At first unnoticed,\
soft,\
and seemingly far away,\
overwhelmed by the noise and conflicts\
of his making,\
it grows.

Through endless circles\
and a myriad of landscapes,\
ceaselessly\
through agonies and ecstasies\
disguised in infinite masks,\
it grows,\
becoming as a Voice\
whispering beyond the threshold\
of his hearing,\
whispering a song\
forever eternal,\
forever untouched by a single jot or tittle\
of all that the Son experiences.

It is a song\
of Truth beyond all doubt,\
a song\
of Reality uncompromised,\
a song\
which sings of the imperishable essence,\
the very essence of his being,\
a song which is\
the Love of the Holy Father.

Though the Voice sings the song\
without ceasing,\
the Son hears not,\
her ears turned not\
to the Voice whose song\
is like one crying in the wilderness,\
but to the din\
of ephemeral shadows\
cast upon the walls of her prison,\
recognizing not the Light\
which lights all darkness,\
believing still that darkness to be\
the Light she would seek,\
the Light that will illuminate her way,\
and reveal the treasure\
she believes resides there.

And still,\
the Father waits,\
abiding in the purity of his Light,\
seeing naught but the radiant splendor\
of his only begotten,\
his beloved,\
his Son,\
eternal.

Still,\
the Son travels.\
Through valleys\
of the shadow of death,\
climbing mountains\
made of the stones of uncertainties,\
fording rivers whose far shores\
often cannot be seen,\
rivers wild with the tumult of emotions\
arising like angry waves\
from depths already seething\
in memories\
clutched tightly in the grasp\
of the one who believes in shadow\
and worships it,\
knowing not that he does so.

And still, the Father waits,\
abiding always in the purity of his Light,\
rejoicing in the perfection of his Son,\
waiting for the child\
to make but one simple,\
quiet choice:\
to awaken!

As she travels on,\
there comes now a moment here,\
and again there,\
moments sadly fleeting,\
yet filled with the clarity\
of the song that calls unto her.

Were she to turn but for an instant\
and embrace what the moment would offer,\
*the journey would be no more*,\
the simple choice recognized,\
and made.

It is but his weariness\
that forces him to pause,\
to rest in that silence\
which is the doorway to his Heart,\
where alone fulfillment resides.

The treasure rests\
in the palm of her hand,\
yet she comprehends it not.

Habituated only\
to the grasping of illusion,\
she has not the capacity\
to recognize what has touched her:\
the Light of the Father\
that would loosen the knot\
binding her to enchantment\
with unceasing emptiness.

Believing himself restored,\
and himself the restorer,\
he plunges headlong once again,\
going on,\
going-where?

He mistakes his endless circling\
for clear direction to the finality\
*he* would make,\
failing to see he travels\
but the same valleys,\
the same mountains,\
the same rivers.

Cleverly cloaking these\
with her own shifting perceptions,\
she beguiles herself into believing\
not that she sees differently,\
but that what she sees\
*is* different and new.

And yet the Father waits,\
ever so patient\
with his beloved Son,\
abiding eternally in the knowledge\
beyond comprehension,\
that the dream his Son would dream\
in truth, exists not;\
rejoicing without ceasing\
in the radiance of his holy child,\
untouched eternally\
by the illusion of sin.

A deepening weariness grows\
in the heart of the dreamer,\
a weariness\
neither understood\
nor recognized\
by the mind accustomed to shadows,\
nor a body blind\
to the seed of Light within it.

The dreamer moves on,\
yet the weariness remains within him,\
unvanquished by his fruitless pause,\
restored not by his habitual escape\
from shadows.

Disconcerted,\
she moves along familiar byways,\
increasingly unable to blot out\
this persistent\
though subtle\
weariness,\
an ache that remains with her,\
no matter the form\
or intensity\
of her efforts to be free of it.

And now,\
fear arises.\
It is a fear unlike\
any he has experienced\
within his countless journeys\
in the fields of illusions.

Not a fear\
from which he can hide,\
nor a fear\
he can successfully suppress\
by heaping upon it\
the weight of evermore enchantments.

It is a fear\
to which she is unaccustomed,\
for it stems not\
from her experience of the world,\
but grows quietly from\
and remains present within\
the core of her being.

Intensifying his efforts\
to find solace in the changing landscapes\
of his dreams\
serves only to confirm\
the reality of his fear.

Unlike anything\
she has yet encountered,\
this fear becomes a constant\
though unwelcome\
companion.

It becomes as a child\
who increasingly refuses to be ignored,\
and the dreamer of a thousand worlds,\
proud author\
of a multitude of illusions,\
survivor of numerous heavens and hells,\
trembles.

In his trembling,\
he does not pause in his vain pursuits\
as much as he is *made* to stop,\
and looking at\
what he would resist seeing,\
he beholds:\
The salt of the world\
has begun to lose its savor.

Weariness\
perceived as fear\
appears to her as an unknown force\
from which she cannot hide,\
yet cannot embrace.\
It seems to run before her\
as she scampers first up one hill,\
greeting her face-to-face at the summit,\
and fording rivers\
swum countless times before,\
she emerges only to find it\
waiting on the far shore.

Beginning to sense\
that this unknown force\
is not to be cast aside,\
the dreamer laments within himself,\
and in the midst of all his doing,\
the faint echo of a sound\
he has forever dreaded\
is heard.

The doer of all deeds is shaken,\
the foundation of his creations\
wobbles and weakens;\
he beholds the force within himself\
and,\
for the first time,\
acknowledges his impending death.

Though she acts within her worlds,\
striving to continue\
in the only way she knows,\
seeking fervently\
to return and remain\
in familiar terrain,\
the forms of her dream\
hold not their enticing allure,\
and her efforts to remain\
in all that she knows\
provide no satisfaction.

Her thirst is not fulfilled,\
and even her sleep is troubled.

The dreamer,\
saddened by the growing loss of luster\
beheld in his dreams,\
becomes as one who grasps at mirages,\
finding naught but emptiness\
in his hands,\
yet continues to grasp\
because it is all he knows to do.

She waits for a death\
she is sure will come,\
both loathing it\
and secretly longing for it.\
She is defeated\
but knows not how,\
nor by what.

The dreams,\
that throughout countless lifetimes\
had fed him with the promise\
of fulfillment,\
wither,\
like parched leaves clinging to branches\
whose source of water\
is mysteriously severed from unseen roots,\
while the power of his life\
drains from his limbs.

The proud dreamer\
has not the energy to dream,\
and believes beyond question\
that where there are not dreams,\
there is not Life,\
and the growing emptiness\
is as a torment to him.

She raises her head only occasionally,\
and feebly,\
hoping to the end to see in her dreams\
the Life she had always sought there.

Finally,\
wearied to the bone\
of fighting what he senses\
but cannot see,\
of what he feels\
but cannot grasp,\
the dreamer releases not only\
the last vestige of his will to dream,\
but lays down\
even the dream of the dreamer,\
and dissolves into what he knows\
must certainly be\
his final, and consummate,\
death.

<div class="center">
![line](Shared/images/line4.jpg)
</div>

<p class="center">*And the first shall be last,\
and the last, first.*</p>

And now,\
the dreamer is laid to rest.

It is a rest\
from which there can be\
no hope of arising.

Unlike the many pauses\
in which the maker of all worlds\
merely retreated to gain strength\
for his journeys,\
this rest\
transcends the world.\
It transcends the body,\
the mind,\
and all the dreamer\
had thought himself to be.

It is a rest\
in which even the soul reclines,\
turned away\
from all enchantments,\
dissolved in the Mystery of all mysteries,\
beyond the pale of words,\
beyond all imagined things.

Verily,\
the dreamer\
is no more to be found.\
Vanished without a trace,\
not only of her ending,\
*but of her beginning;*\
the journey which *seemed* to be,\
is *not*.

And the last,\
made to be first,\
is again become last.

Not by a force which comes\
from outside the dreamer,\
but a force which already abides\
in the very seed\
of the dreamer’s beginning;\
the certainty of his death\
is present in his birth\
and must inevitably flower,\
its petals blotting out\
the very dream of the dreamer itself.

Yet what is perceived\
by the dreamer\
as the darkness of certain death,\
the giving up of all hope for salvation\
in the things of the worlds\
she has conjured into being,\
is not darkness,\
but Light.

It is that Light which lights all things,\
the echo of an endless song\
coming as a thief in the night,\
the eternal voice of our Holy Father.

And the Voice\
has overcome\
the shouting of the world,\
restoring the Son\
to a rest true and deep,\
a rest which alone can heal and transform\
the heart of his holy Son.

The one who would be\
the dreamer of all worlds rests,\
unseen by a world\
unaware of what occurs in its midst,\
all boundaries\
that have defined her form\
dissolved in incomprehensible Light.

The Son abides\
in the rest of perfect Grace.

What was last\
and made first\
is again made last.

And all the heavens rejoice\
beyond the capacity of the world\
to hear.

And now is the world,\
entranced by the power of its dreams,\
lifted gently toward\
the open arms of God.

At the end of a holy instant,\
incapable of measurement\
by a world imprisoned in time,\
the rest of the only begotten\
Son of God\
gives rise to a movement\
not born of a mind\
bound to the illusion of separation,\
but of the eternal Heart\
of the arisen Christ,\
a movement that would take him\
not back into the dream of the world,\
but ever deeper\
into the Reality of his being:\
a journey *within* the Kingdom of Heaven.

Awakened,\
the mind free\
from the shackles of want,\
the body free\
from useless demands\
made by a self that never was,\
a heart beating only\
by the breath of the Most High,\
the arisen Christ moves\
where once the world arose,\
seeing naught but the glory\
of his Father’s Kingdom:\
radiance beyond description,\
joy without boundary,\
purpose in which\
fulfillment is certain.

Here,\
no trace of effort\
is to be found.

Here,\
no taint of striving\
clouds his perception.

Here,\
no constriction of the heart\
by the grand illusion of fear\
is felt.

Reduced to simplicity,\
exalted above all things,\
the one transformed\
by the miracle of Grace\
lives and walks.\
Behold!\
The dreamer,\
now transformed,\
is reborn as the one\
through whom the Father alone\
works to transfigure the world.

For darkness shall become as Light,\
extended without end\
until Creation itself is no more.

Indeed,\
the first is again, first.

As it was in the beginning,\
is now,\
and forever shall be.

The Prodigal Son\
is returned,\
and all of Heaven is shaken\
by the praise of the Heavenly Host;\
the Father and the Son\
rest together as one\
in that peace which forever passes\
all understanding.

To any among you\
who has ears to hear,\
*let her hear*.

And all things *are* made new.

<p class="tr_break top"><span class="dropcaps">S</span>*ervantship*\
It appears an odd word,\
yet within it lies the meaning of sacrifice,\
of Love,\
of true Being.</p>

What, then,\
can we say of sacrifice?

The cloak of ignorance\
has been cast off,\
the darkness of a solitary thought\
dissolved in the simple brilliance\
of a Light far brighter\
than ten thousand suns,\
and the soul of one\
who has seen through the vanity\
of useless wandering\
is again restored\
to the place from which\
it has not ever ventured forth.

The holy one\
is again become first,\
and sees that nowhere\
is there to be found a second.

<div class="indent">
I AM the first-born of my Father,\
standing before all things. \
Moving not,\
I travel far. \
Embracing all things, I touch myself.

Creation arises within me.\
I AM the first and the last,\
the alpha and omega.

Fulfilled begond all measure,\
I need nothing.\
Possessing the whole of Creation,\
I desire nothing.

That which has been,\
I AM.\
That which is,\
I AM.\
That which shall be,\
I AM.

Looking far,\
I behold not my ancient beginning.\
Gazing near,\
I see not my end.

I AM a circle of heavenly Light\
embracing all things,\
knowing all things,\
allowing all things.

My splendor\
fills the vastness of space\
and is contained\
between two thoughts.

The wind is birthed\
from my holy breath,\
and carries my glory\
to all far places.

I AM the power\
by which all dreams are dreamt.

I AM the purpose\
of all actions performed.

I AM the Way,\
the Truth, and the Life,\
and the whole of Creation\
returns to the Father through me.

I AM the praying,\
the prayer,\
and the answer.

I AM the dream,\
the dreamer,\
and her awakening.

I AM the sin,\
the sinner,\
and the salvation.

I AM the vast ocean\
from which\
the dew drop arises.

I AM the tear\
on the cheek of a newborn\
who brings me into form and time.

I AM the words\
before your eyes,\
the writer,\
and the one who even now reads.

I AM the one dreamer\
bold enough to imagine\
the illusion of separation,\
and the one worthy\
of releasing the allure of sleep.

I AM,\
simply, that,\
I AM.
</div>

It is this\
that the awakened Son proclaims,\
without a trace of thought\
to obscure the brilliance and purity\
of his being.

She looks for herself,\
and sees only\
the Father.

He reaches to himself,\
and embraces only\
the whole of Creation.

The glass,\
once filled with a momentary thought\
of imaginary sustenance,\
is again\
become the emptiness\
overflowing with living waters.

The holy chalice\
is raised to her lips.\
She drinks eternally,\
and is satisfied.

Herein\
is the meaning of sacrifice:\
Never has there existed\
what must be eternally unreal,\
and what is *not*\
can be neither lost\
nor sacrificed.

What, then,\
would you cling\
so tightly unto?

<div class="center">
![line](Shared/images/line4.jpg)
</div>

Servantship\
is that which arises\
when the death\
of what could never possibly be\
is irrevocably allowed.

It is the perfect heritage\
extended from the Father\
to the Son,\
and is of one substance\
with the Mystery\
that our Heavenly Father is.

Servantship\
requires only\
the *enactment* of sacrifice,\
that sacrifice which is,\
from the beginning,\
already completed:\
the Grace of God.

Our choice to remember\
who we are\
is the enactment\
of that sacrifice\
already made in Heaven.

Sacrifice,\
when completed,\
gives rise to the birth of Love\
both unconditional\
and incomprehensible,\
a Love which can only come\
to be truly recognized\
when any mind finally,\
and irrevocably,\
chooses to awaken\
from the senseless dream\
of the dreamer.

It is not a love tainted\
by being directed\
to the objects of the world,\
nor felt only when a mind\
momentarily perceives a satisfaction\
born of the temporary *organization*\
of the objects and events it embraces,\
for no such love\
is truly unconditional.

Therefore,\
such love perceived\
is not Love at all.

But what arises\
is that self-same Love\
that is already with us\
from before time *is*,\
the Love from which the\
Son of God is birthed,\
the Love which has already\
fulfilled the Atonement\
required by the brief -\
and meaningless -\
thought of separation.

It is that Love\
which *is*\
the very presence of God,\
who is Love itself,\
and *only* this.

Love seeks not for itself,\
but finds its completion\
in its eternal\
and unreserved extension.

It is a Love\
enacted by the Son\
which unceasingly mirrors\
the Love by which the Father\
has begotten the Son.

It is a Love\
which gives when asked\
and holds nothing for itself.

It is a Love\
that embraces all things,\
for it sees no separation\
in the whole of Creation.

It is a Love\
that touches all who behold it\
with a gentleness and certainty\
whose taste is sweet above honey;\
it quenches the thirst of the soul.

And this,\
without effort,\
for it is a Love\
that extends from -\
and to -\
true Being.

Seeing naught but the substance\
of what alone is Real\
in all that its eyes rest upon,\
it severs with the sword of wisdom\
the stranglehold of illusions\
from the heart\
of the one who beholds\
the person of the arisen Christ.

It is not a Love\
to be created,\
but a Love that has finally\
*been allowed*,\
rising without resistance\
from the soil of perfect surrender.

The dreamer,\
vanquished and reborn,\
decrees:

<div class="indent">
I live,\
yet not I,\
but Christ,\
dwells as me.
</div>

And the Word is made flesh,\
and dwells among us.

*In* the world,\
but not *of* the world,\
for the world is overcome\
not by effort,\
but by Grace...\
the simple correction\
of one mistaken perception.

<div class="center">
![line](Shared/images/line4.jpg)
</div>

Who, then,
is the servant?\
What is she likened unto?

The servant is *free*.\
No longer fettered\
to the tiny fears\
once seen as unscalable walls\
reaching to block\
the Light of the Son,\
he loves not the things of the world,\
for they hold no value.

The servant is *humble*.\
No longer fettered\
to the false arrogance\
that once was made\
to shield her from her aloneness,\
she clings not to false knowledge,\
for she knows that *she does not know*,\
nor does she need to.\
Trusting all things,\
allowing all things,\
she transcends all things\
by first loving and embracing\
all things.\
And their passing\
leaves not a trace upon her.

The servant is *capable*.\
With no anxiety\
for the things of tomorrow,\
he enacts\
the incomprehensible Love\
of the Father *in this moment*.\
Innocent as a child,\
he considers not limitation,\
for he sees with certainty that:

<div class="indent">
The works I do\
you also shall do,\
and greater works than these\
shall you do.
</div>

He knows simply\
that of himself he does nothing,\
but the Father through him\
does all things.\
Where could incapacity arise?

Emptied of herself,\
the servant effortlessly\
dons the cloak\
given her of the Father,\
whether the cloak of this world\
or another.\
She moves freely\
between Heaven and Earth,\
rejoicing always\
as the embodiment\
of prayer without ceasing:\
“Holy Father, *now* there is Light!”

The servant\
is likened unto one\
who has journeyed to a distant land,\
for his master had commanded him:

<div class="indent">
Go, and share with all\
who have ears to hear\
and eyes to see.

Give to them of my abundance,\
and give freely.
</div>

Now,\
when the servant heard,\
she went immediately forth\
and was found -\
from waking to sleeping -\
to be doing\
as her master had asked.

And it came to pass\
that many who received\
secretly laughed\
at the folly of the servant.\
Many thought him mad,\
and many more\
either lost or discarded\
what he shared with them.

Only a few,\
having heard,\
received what was given to them\
and went and did likewise,\
for in their hearing\
they became like the servant,\
and what they gave away\
was returned to them tenfold.

So joyous in her task\
was the servant\
that she could hear not\
the judgments of the small-minded.

<div class="indent">
Will you choose to have ears to hear?
</div>

The servant\
is one who has\
transcended history.

Quite literally,\
she looks upon her past\
and sees it, indeed,\
as having *passed* away,\
dissolved as mist\
before the arising sun\
from deep and forested valleys.

Not one dark corner remains\
in the valleys of the mind,\
cut and shaped by the forces\
of limiting thought.

Rivers of radiant Light\
flow unimpeded now,\
emanating from the ocean of God’s Love,\
cascading waterfalls of vision\
that embrace the whole of Creation.

Though disguised in simplicity,\
the servant sees\
his every loving gesture\
touching the farthest star,\
and participating in the miracle\
of the Atonement.

The servant\
always recognizes his own.\
Herein is revealed\
the true body of Christ,\
the mystical Church\
which far transcends\
the loftiest of theologies.\
Herein is revealed\
the essence of brotherhood.

The servant\
seeks out her own\
and celebrates with them\
*without ceasing*,\
for awakened minds\
are eternally joined as one.

The servant is *gentle*.\
Clinging not\
to what is not given her to do,\
neither anger\
nor impatience\
arises.

The servant *trusts*.\
Embracing all things,\
having given the world\
up to his Father,\
he is content in *this* moment.\
The whole is present in the part,\
and the part embraces the whole.\
Forgetting not Heaven,\
he blesses Earth,\
and even his smile illuminates the world.

With nothing to do,\
she does nothing.\
With all things to do,\
she accomplishes all things -\
yet sees not a trace of distinction\
between these.

The servant is at *peace*.\
But more:\
he *is* peace.

Receiving doubt,\
he returns Love.\
Receiving judgment,\
she returns Love.\
Receiving the projections of fear,\
he returns Love.\
Receiving love\
not yet made wholly pure,\
she returns Love.

Receiving Love\
given purely,\
he allows himself to receive it.

Abiding in unbroken union\
with God,\
she receives Love\
without ceasing.

Though the world gives\
and takes away,\
his cup is always filled;\
he drinks deeply with every breath.\
Satiated,\
he laughs at the world’s illusions,\
and his laughter heals the world.

The servant\
is simply incomprehensible\
to the perceptions of the world.\
For where the world perceives lack,\
the servant knows unlimited abundance.\
Where the world perceives struggle,\
the servant knows perfect harmony.\
Where the world perceives\
the pressure of time,\
the servant knows the grace of eternity.

No reconciliation is possible,\
for the things of Heaven and Earth\
shall pass away,\
but the things of God shall not.

And the first -\
made so by the worldshall\
be last.

The last -\
being the creation of God -\
shall again be made first\
in the mind of the awakened\
joyous,\
servant of God,\
*who is but Love*.

As it was in the beginning,\
is now,\
and forever shall be.\

<div class="center">
![line](Shared/images/line4.jpg)
</div>

What, then,\
can the qualities\
of genuine service\
be likened unto?\
Observe the waters\
that flow from the highest mountains,\
winding, cascading, twisting, churning,\
resting inevitably in the sea.

Their destination\
is neither hoped for, nor imagined.\
It is *known*,\
resting always in certainty.\
And once the journey has begun,\
the end is certain.

The river begins\
as but a drop of rain\
that falls from the heavens\
freely given.

It forms itself in places unseen\
and is shaped into a constant flow\
that is not interrupted.

Seemingly shaped by the earth it touches,\
it becomes the shaper of waterfalls\
and canyons;\
and what river of living waters\
does not speak of beauty\
to its beholder?

The river nurtures\
all that it touches\
with the very sustenance of Life.\
It recognizes not obstacles to its journey,\
but -\
by embracing them -\
overcomes them.\
Even the sound of its passing\
brings respite to those who listen.

It laments not\
when others draw from it,\
seemingly without gratitude,\
for it knows its Source to be unlimited.

The secret of its peace,\
and of its certain power, is this:\
*It already abides at one with the sea*,\
having arisen from it,\
and returning always to it.

No veil of illusion\
has arisen in its being\
to create a sense of separation.\
Therefore,\
its journey begins in its certain end.

Let your service be given\
like unto the rivers of life\
that flow from the highest mountains\
to the sea.

Think not *you* must know\
the nature of the journey,\
nor that *you* must judge\
whether the twists and turns\
are acceptable.

For unto you there is given\
the gift of one teacher\
whose guidance never errs.\
His Voice is certain,\
his presence eternal.\
Have I not said unto you:\
“I will send you a Comforter?”

Yet,\
the one whom I send\
was received by me of our Father.\
Because I have received Him,\
He is given unto you equally.\
Like an ancient melody,\
his Voice is as a gentle song\
at once familiar;\
silence is the threshold\
that carries the heart\
to the inner chamber of the Holy One.

To give truly,\
one must give all they have.

For to give\
while holding one part back\
is to believe one has *not* all things.\
And to she who believes she has not,\
much will be taken,\
while to she who knows she has all,\
even more shall be added,\
and her giving shall be unlimited\
and without end.

<p class="indent">She who gives all receives all.</p>

The true servant gives even this:\
all traces of attachment\
to the fruit of her giving.\
For her giving has been already seen\
to be from the Father,\
and so the fruits are given to her.

Thus the servant proclaims:\
“Why do you call me good?\
There is only one who is good:\
God, who is but Love.\
And if you would truly receive\
what I would give you,\
go, and do likewise.”

Hear again:

<p class="indent">He who gives all, receives all.</p>

The servant\
gives as he has been given,\
but remembers it not.\
Caring not for the accolades of the world,\
he collects no ribbons,\
and keeps no trophy.\
But the face of Christ\
seen in each he serves\
is etched in his awareness forever;\
he remembers them\
and gives thanks to the Father,\
for the servant lives\
the simplest of truths:

<p class="indent">My brothers and sisters are my salvation.</p>

The servant knows she fixes nothing.\
Seeing not a fearful world,\
she does not deliver it from “evil.”\
Looking not upon illness,\
she calls not herself a healer.

Herein,\
learn the secret of the miraculous:\
The servant does nothing\
save to extend Love\
to the Christ who dwells in another,\
having learned to see\
past the appearances\
that are the world;\
and the one who is ill\
recognizes that the servant\
has recognized her\
*as she is*, and decrees:\
“I am seen as I AM,\
and release my illusions now.”

Love heals,\
and Love alone.

Those unaccustomed to miracles\
run after the servant, asking:\
“How do you do these things?”\
To which the servant replies:\
“Love has done these things.\
Of myself,\
I only asked that my Father\
correct my perception of you.”

Love will flow through any mind\
that asks for\
and allows\
the correction of its perceptions.

How, then,\
does the servant serve?

By being *only* the presence of Love.

The extension of Love,\
untainted by the thought of a doer,\
is the quality of genuine service,\
a reflection in this world\
of the Love which begets eternally\
the holy and only begotten child of God.

</div>

<p class="tr_break top"><span class="dropcaps">H</span>e who looks upon me\
and truly *sees* me\
has learned\
to look upon himself\
*as our Father knows him.*</p>

She who sees me,\
thus has she seen\
the One who has sent me,\
even as she, too,\
has been sent of the Father\
to proclaim but this:

<p class="indent">Love alone is Real.\
God is but Love.\
Therefore,\
God __is__.</p>

Herein lies the meaning of my words,\
read often,\
yet often not understood:

<p class="indent">It is not possible\
for what is Real to be threatened,\
nor is it possible\
for what is unreal to exist.</p>

Because you know *only* that you exist,\
you must be in God,\
and cannot be threatened\
in any way.

Nor does the illumined mind\
behold the place where it begins\
and God ends.

For what alone is Real\
is without beginning or end.

Yet,\
always does such a mind\
recognize that it is created,\
and not Creator,\
knowing not the unfathomable Source\
of its beginning.

This recognition\
is the seat of humility.\
Humility begets\
the recognition of freedom,\
and in perfect freedom\
lies true power:

<p class="indent">I can do absolutely nothing,\
nor need I do anything,\
for the One who has sent me\
alone does all things.</p>

Joy flows gently from the heart\
of one who has awakened.

It is a joy\
neither created nor possessed,\
but *allowed*.\
Flowing as the radiant extension\
of a Light that meets no obstacle,\
it attracts those\
who would choose to Remember,\
and behold themselves reflected\
in the one who has awakened.

When you see me\
in the face of your brother and sister,\
you become the mirror\
of their only Reality,\
and in *you* can they know Christ.

Therefore,\
your relationship with each of them\
is the means of your salvation,\
and your only appropriate gift to them\
is to be one who has refused to tolerate\
the error of separation\
in yourself,\
offering to them the gift of *their* perfect –\
and holy –\
reflection.

The holiest place on Earth is, indeed,\
wherever an ancient hatred\
has become a present love.\
Hatred *is* ancient,\
being born of separation;\
having a beginning,\
it must have an end.

Love,\
being of God,\
knows neither beginning nor end.

To offer your brother and sister\
the gift of your holiness\
is to offer the gift of what is eternal.\
Eternity must speak to them of Grace,\
and by Grace and Grace alone\
the world is overcome.

Join with me\
and offer our friends\
the holiness\
you share with me\
from before the foundations\
of the world.

Nothing beyond this\
can be found,\
and in this\
there is nothing lacking.\
All searching has ended,\
and in what is eternal\
there can be nothing you want still.

In giving your Self,\
you must remember your Self.\
This alone\
is the straight and narrow path,\
the bridge given you when,\
in a distant and forgotten past,\
you looked upon one insane thought,\
*and failed to laugh*.

Your seriousness\
made the insanity of separation\
seem real to you.

Gone now is all fear,\
for we see together\
that what is unreal\
cannot possibly exist.

Now,\
we are safe.\
Now,\
peace has come.\
Giving this alone to everyone,\
we have received it forever.

The servant gives,\
and therefore receives.

I have said\
that I come to gather my friends\
to myself.

Gather those who are given to you,\
and it is enough.\
And because you have received\
the ones I send to you\
in order that they might behold\
in your holiness\
their true reflection,\
verily,\
you have received me.\
And our friendship must be eternal,\
being established in God.

When I said,\
“Go, and do likewise,”\
it is just this\
to which I was referring.

<p class="indent">For as many as received Him,\
gave He the power to become\
the Sons and Daughters\
of the Living God.</p>

This can only mean\
that when you give the gift\
of *your* holiness,\
you have paid witness to the truth\
that you *have* received me.

Because you have allowed me\
to raise you from the dead,\
*you* are the one\
in whom I now live,\
and the only logical meaning\
of the Second Coming\
is witnessed by those\
who are given to you.

If but one of our precious friends\
sees that I live in you,\
*the whole of Creation is uplifted.*

You are sent forth “in my name”\
to extend the power to awaken\
unto all who will be sent to you,\
and in you will they be provided\
with the opportunity to see themselves\
as they are held eternally\
in the mind of God.

Remember\
that in the Kingdom\
there is no effort.\
Because you are awake in me,\
*you need do nothing,*\
yet not one thing\
shall be left undone.\
And what I ask of you\
you will accomplish,\
because our wills are joined.

It is not possible that you fail,\
for this would mean\
that God has failed me,\
and my Father fails not his Son.

The choice for Love,\
which is the end of fear,\
is the choice to see\
with the eyes of Christ:

<p class="ident">God has not failed me,\
and I cannot fail those\
who are sent to me,\
because the One who has sent me\
lives in me.</p>

Giving them to God –\
by seeing that Christ is in them –\
they are received *through* me,\
but *by* God,\
who receives his own.

All praise to the One\
beyond all comprehension!\
I am *not* the doer,\
I am *not* the maker.\
I AM\
but the humble servant,\
allowing\
the witnessing of Love in me,\
*because* Christ lives in me.\
And this *is* enough.

What perfection the world reveals!

What sublime beauty\
do all things show me!

My joy\
is beyond measure,\
my pleasure unending!

Weariness is gone,\
and the dance begun.

The song of the One\
in whom I dwell\
lifts me gently in dancing!

The leaves tossed in the wind,\
the laughter of a child,\
the radiance of the farthest star,\
each one who stands before me,\
these are the partners\
with whom I dance!

Perfection shines forth\
in all things;\
the weaver of the dance is trusted.

If I am with you in this moment,\
we dance as friends in holiness,\
for we cannot fail to be\
where God has asked us to be.

The eternal melody shifts,\
and moves on.\
I dance with the one sent unto me,\
yet lose not the one\
who appears to have gone.\
For minds that have joined in Love\
can in no way be separate,\
one from another.

Fail not to dance, oh holy Son of God!\
Know you not what comes to pass?

The crucifixion is past,\
the resurrection completed,\
and ascension now descends upon us\
as a gentle dove,\
lifting us to the abode\
of the One who is but Love!

Forget you not to dance\
with every breath you breathe,\
for Love waits upon your welcome,\
and desires to be heard\
with every spoken word!

*You* are the one sent forth from God!\
*You* are the one\
in whom He remains\
eternally well pleased!\
*You* are the one in whom I live,\
and reveal myself to the world!\
*You*, precious friend,\
you are as I AM!

In your joyousness\
is my laughter heard.\
In your giving\
am I received.

Dance you therefore with passion,\
not for the things of the world,\
but for that which alone is Real\
and cannot be taken from us.

Because Light\
is reborn in *you*,\
your brothers and sisters rejoice!\
You have become their salvation\
and they, yours.\
Their gratitude is joined with mine,\
and our voices are raised as one:\
“God *is*!”

The ancient melody is heard,\
the sacred and happy dance enjoined.\
Because we dance,\
we *do* know what comes to pass.\
We are the bringers of Heaven to Earth,\
that the things of the world\
might be forgotten,\
and the purpose of time\
might be completed.

The translation\
of a brief and harmless dream\
is finished,\
and all things are quietly returned.

The Sonship is remembered as One\
and the first, *is* first,\
eternally.

The field of obstacles\
through which the dreamer stumbles\
are but various symbols\
of the one thing\
he seems to have created in error.\
For appearances *are* error\
and nothing more.

I have often said –\
in many ways\
and through many channels –\
that there is but one lesson\
you need learn:

<p class="indent">There is nothing outside you.</p>

As with all expressions of wisdom,\
this statement is true\
at many levels.

Levels appear to exist\
as long as the dream seems to remain.\
Because you are awake,\
the idea of levels\
no longer pertains to you.

Therefore,\
the “secret” of this work\
is now revealed;\
it is given to those\
who are the teachers of God,\
for only they will truly\
and clearly\
understand it.

In knowing that they\
do understand it,\
they will know they have received\
the “sign from Heaven”\
I once promised them.\
Now\
they are free\
to take up their cross\
and follow me,\
for where I have gone\
they now can come.\
And the whole thought structure\
of the world\
has been reversed in them.

Because it is completed in them,\
it shall quickly be completed\
in the entire Sonship.\
This are they certain of,\
and our voices *are* raised as one.

<div class="center">
![line](Shared/images/line4.jpg)
</div>

All things perceived\
arise only within the mind.\
Because all minds are joined,\
whatever is perceived has arisen\
in *one* mind,\
shared equally by all.

To say “all minds are joined”\
is to say only that there is one mind,\
and the things of Heaven and Earth\
arise\
and pass away\
within it.

You have learned\
that the body’s senses\
have led you to believe\
that everything\
beyond the boundary\
of the body\
is outside you.\
But you have recognized\
that *this cannot be true.*

It has always made sense to you\
that your thoughts are not outside you.\
It has required great courage\
to learn the truth\
that your brother’s or sister’s thought\
is *also not outside you.*

Until recently,\
you have remained fearful\
of taking the next logical step.\
While just a few traces of guilt remained\
you have feared what you perceived\
as an overwhelming responsibility.

But because the Father\
has taken the final step for you,\
you abide in the perfect safety\
where the next step\
is no longer fearful.

I have said that the Holy Spirit\
never teaches you\
what you are still\
fearful of learning.\
Because of this, two things follow.

First:\
Before you chose\
to be awake in me,\
it appeared that a prayer\
could fail to be answered.\
This was because you feared\
receiving the answer,\
and so it was not given you.\
But what you were willing to receive\
always *was* given.

Now,\
because you are willing\
to receive all,\
all *is* given you.\
Yet,\
because your eyes are open,\
you no longer pray\
“in vain.”\
This means only\
that you have gone beyond\
the childish prayers for those things\
you once believed you needed\
to save you\
from what you thought you feared.\
Because fear is gone,\
childish prayer has vanished.

Awake in our Remembrance,\
you have learned to pray\
only for the Atonement of the Sonship,\
and have extended to me\
your willingness to join with me\
in answering the only true prayer.

This has required\
the re-learning of trust,\
and trust is the inevitable fruit\
of the forgiveness\
you have extended to the world,\
of which you are a worthy part.

This willingness\
has given me permission\
to dismantle the “mansions”\
you had made in error;\
every teacher of God\
has faced crucifixion.

Through forgiveness,\
and mastery\
of the keys to the Kingdom,\
you have passed through\
the eye of the needle\
to join me in the resurrection.\
All things *have* been made new again!

Second:\
Because you are now taking\
the next step,\
it must mean that the fear\
which had kept\
what you prayed for from you\
is *no longer present.*

This can only mean\
that my promise has been kept:\
I have given you my strength\
until yours has become\
as certain as mine.\
Because you know that I live in you,\
your strength *is* as certain as mine,\
and the next step\
we can now take together.

For those who have chosen\
to learn this curriculum\
through my *Course in Miracles,*\
you will clearly remember\
that it was not designed\
to answer every question\
a teacher of God might have.\
It could not do so,\
being only a teaching device\
aimed at a specific goal:\
peace.

Peace is the necessary foundation\
from which the teacher of God\
moves to complete the Atonement\
on Earth,\
*as it is already completed in Heaven.*

Now\
are we ready\
to take the necessary step,\
and accept the final meaning\
of the one lesson:

<p class="indent">There is nothing outside you.</p>

You are your brother’s keeper\
because you *are* your brother.

The translation\
of the unhappy dream of separation\
into the final,\
happy dream –\
the final manifestation in time –\
requires that it be accomplished\
*through you.*

Those of you\
who understand clearly\
the meaning of this work\
are those in whom all preparation\
is completed.\
You have learned\
that the purpose of your life\
is *exactly the same as was mine,*\
to demonstrate that, with God,\
all things are not simply possible,\
but inevitable.

You are now ready\
to become a *living demonstration*\
of *complete mastery*.

Because all resistance is gone\
(for what is ego but this?),\
the discipline necessary\
for the completion of your demonstration\
is as an “easy yoke.”\
It is a discipline\
that must joyfully touch\
upon every aspect of your life.

It is through you\
that the simple and natural righteousness\
of God’s “laws”\
can be demonstrated.

Mastery in *every* aspect\
of the life given unto you\
is the only way you can teach\
your brother and your sister\
that God *is*.

This means that now\
we look together\
beyond the mind’s tendency\
to separate itself from the world\
by looking upon aspects of life\
not yet mastered,\
and decreeing them to be simply illusions.\
While this is true,\
it is not appropriate to conclude\
that they be left untransformed.

To those with ears to hear:\
It is simply not possible to transcend\
what you refuse to acknowledge\
and embrace.\
Denial is but the ploy of ego\
to ensure that your Self\
remains imprisoned,\
and *the ego* remains enthroned.

Again I ask of you:

<p class="indent">What do you __want__, truly?</p>

# Book Four {#bk4}
<div class="center">

</div>

<p class="tr_break top"><span class="dropcaps">S</span>elf-mastery and servantship\
are one.\
For where one is, the other is found.</p>

And where the other is,\
the one is also known.

Mastery is that state\
in which not one thing of the world\
*compels* you in any direction,\
yet not one thing of the world is judged.\
This must naturally follow\
for the mind to which peace is returned.

To lack mastery\
in any aspect of life\
is to lack it in all.

Mastery\
is the foundation from which\
the servant enacts\
the movement of Love\
proceeding from the Father\
through the Son,\
serving the one goal of Atonement\
by demonstrating its completion\
*in you.*

This is given\
as a clear sign unto you:\
Mastery is completed when not one habit\
learned of the world remains;\
not one “love”\
you have miscreated for yourself\
is justified of you.

Look well, then,\
at the whole of your life,\
and behold with innocent honesty\
the “loves” you would keep for yourself,\
for what can you carry forth\
from death to Life?\
Even the body will be outshined.

And if you love the Father\
above the world,\
what would you leave untransformed\
by the radiance of your union?

You can give\
only what you possess,\
and what you possess exists for you\
only because you value it.

What treasure\
will you lay at your brother’s feet?\
For where your treasure is,\
there shall your heart be also,\
and your heart is all that *can* be given.

I have said before\
that the world is but a *symbol*.\
Choose wisely what *your* world\
will symbolize for you,\
for it is the symbols you choose\
which your sister will see.\
Thus is your heart revealed,\
and you have “spoken” your judgment\
of the Father.

She who knows me\
walks with me,\
and she who walks with me\
makes straight her path,\
and all things are given\
to the praise of what God is:\
Love.

Love embraces all things,\
heals all things,\
transforms all things,\
celebrates all things,\
and, above all,\
mirrors what God is *in* all things.

Give no thought, then,\
for tomorrow,\
neither for the things you shall eat,\
nor for the things you shall wear,\
for the Father knows you have need\
of these things,\
and He will not leave you comfortless.

When I once asked you\
to “take no thought”\
you unwittingly failed to hear me,\
deciding *you* can direct the choice\
of what you would eat,\
and what you would wear,\
and thus cleverly cherish\
the “loves” you would desire to keep.\
To decide for yourself\
is precisely to *take* thought.\
That is,\
because you failed\
to let the Comforter choose for you,\
right-mindedness was cast aside,\
and the real world abandoned.

But she\
who praises God in *all* things\
keeps no decision for herself,\
listening only to the Voice for God,\
and the servant knows\
the Voice speaks only\
with perfect reason.\
To cling to but one “love”\
you have miscreated\
is surely to be unreasonable,\
for you have learned\
that the symbols of the world\
can be but the symbols of death.\
Death is no longer your will,\
but Life.

I am come again unto you\
that you might have Life,\
and this more abundantly.\
Learn well, then,\
to ask before each choice:\
“Does this value the symbols of death,\
or of Life?”

Abiding in innocent honesty,\
you will realize\
that the Comforter’s guidance\
is immediate,\
and uncompromising.

Herein will be revealed to you\
the final meaning of my teaching:

<p class="indent">Take no thought,\
for the Father knows\
you have need of these things.</p>

In this,\
the next step *has* been taken.

Released from the insane belief in sacrifice\
and loss,\
not a single “love”\
does the servant keep for himself.

Knowing\
with a certainty beyond question\
who walks with him\
in the way that he chooses to go,\
he steps with gentle authority\
on the path set before him.

Caring not for what she will wear\
nor for what she shall eat,\
she listens for the Voice\
of the Holy One.

Because her prayer is only\
for that which can reflect\
the Father’s perfect Love through her,\
her joy is forever complete.\
And the Comforter’s guidance\
is without reproach,\
revealing the gifts\
that are brought to serve\
the one desire that alone arises\
in the holy mind of the servant:

<p class="indent">That all I do\
and all I say,\
that all I think\
and all I share,\
that all I be, do, and have,\
reflect the radiance,\
the joy,\
the grace,\
the laughter,\
the compassion,\
the power,\
the vision,\
and the mastery\
of my Father’s one creation:\
Christ, I AM!</p>

And the things that she wears\
and the things that she eats\
whisper to the world\
of the Love with which the Father\
has restored his precious child\
to her rightful place.

<div class="center">
![line](Shared/images/line4.jpg)
</div>

Whenever you are not wholly joyous,\
it is because you have chosen wrongly.\
For from choice there follows action,\
and from action always experience.

For those with ears to hear,\
let them hear:\
He who has learned that death is unreal\
gladly releases the symbols of death\
even within the illusions of time,\
down to the least jot and tittle.

The awakened servant,\
having truly chosen\
to teach *only* Love\
because Love alone is desired,\
moves from the silent foundation of union\
unto Life *everlasting*,\
teaching only the symbols of Life,\
for by teaching he learns\
and by giving he receives.

The Way, then,\
*is* easy,\
and without effort.

From the thoughts\
you would choose to think,\
to what you would eat\
and what you would wear,\
*take no thought of yourself,*\
but receive the guidance\
of the One sent unto you of the Father,\
because He has loved you\
from before the foundation of *all* worlds.

Herein,\
while time seems to last for you,\
are all things translated\
into that which reflects\
the holy of holies,\
and what was hidden is now revealed.

I gave even the body\
that it might be glorified\
in glad tribute to my Father.\
For she who gives all,\
receives all.

Remember then,\
what I say unto you now:\
If your brother is hungry,\
*you* are without nourishment,\
and if your sister is alone,\
*you* are separated from the feast.\
Because there is\
nothing outside you;\
you are the good shepherd.\
And l ask only for you\
to accept the truth\
that because you have chosen\
to awaken to your own call,\
the time is at hand\
for embracing with me\
all that is given you,\
that the world\
might be restored in us,\
the holy, unlimited,\
and *only* begotten child of God.

If you will do this with me,\
all things *will* be embraced,\
and Love will light all things.

Be you, therefore, of good courage.\
Love one another\
as I love you, always.\
Rejoice,\
and celebrate with one another often,\
for if there are two or more\
gathered together to embrace the world,\
I *am* in the midst of them.

We walk now with certainty,\
holding not one “love”\
back from the teacher\
who would heal all wounds,\
and translate even the body –\
the symbol of ego –\
into that which reflects only Light\
to a world redeemed\
from the dream of separation.

The final lesson has been learned,\
and now will be gladly lived:

<p class="indent">There is nothing outside me.</p>

Now, it is finished.

He who understands these words,\
lives them,\
and his life is a dance of devotion\
without ceasing,\
unlimited forever,\
for he knows what comes to pass.

The happy dream dawns now,\
having been placed safely within you\
by God himself\
even as you were –\
for but one brief moment –\
distracted by a tiny, mad idea.

My peace\
I give unto you.\
Not as the world gives,\
do I give unto you.\
Because you have received me,\
you give me to the world.\
Because you give me,\
do you eternally receive me,\
forever,\
and ever.

Peace be unto you,\
beloved,\
precious,\
and ancient\
friend.

<p class="indent">Amen</p>

# EPILOGUE {#epi}

__LOVE__. It *does* ride on every breath we breathe, and over the course of
this experience with ]eshua, I have learned that Love *does* desire to be
heard with every single spoken word. Jeshua is a master of it, but his
mastery does not place Him above us. He will wait patiently, perhaps
perceived as a little ahead of us, until we recognize that what awaits
us, what has *always* awaited us, is the choice for Love. It is a choice
in which all other options collapse, a choice which, in the final
analysis, is actually revealed to our awakened minds as the *choiceless
choice.* Has there ever been any other viable option?

Love can seem so frightening! It requires the deep recognition that the
past is *passed away.* It requires that we come home to *this* present
moment, relinquishing our need to be right, our penchant for blaming,
and above all, claiming complete responsibility for everything we think,
feel, say, and do. It also must come to mean that we accept
responsibility *for the world we see.* If the world isn’t changing, we
must not be changing!

*The spoken word.* Not merely verbal communication, for *we are the thought
of Love in form.* Our every gesture, then, “speaks” to the world of what
we are choosing to lay up as our treasures. But more than this, our
every gesture speaks also to us, whispering what our choice has been,
and *offering the perfect freedom to choose again*.

Together, we stand now on the threshold of something new, something
unparalleled, at least in known history. The pulse of change is
everywhere felt. Technology is making the world
a very small place, indeed. In an instant, the experience of a brother
or sister living on the other side of the globe is brought into our
living room, their voices compelling us to stretch our hearts wide, to
accept them, too, as true family. Can *we* love enough? No, I think not.
But, thank *God*, Love itself is enough, for surely God *is* Love, waiting
on our welcome.

In nearly twenty years, as this PathWay we now call the Way of Mastery
has unfolded under His meticulous guidance, I have seen time and time
again the undeniable truth that there really is no order of difficulty
in the miracles Love can bring forth, when we simply join our hearts and
hands and offer Love the tiny bit of willingness it takes to suspend our
judgments and learn anew. Oh, yes, Love is enough. Beneath every denied
feeling, beneath every anger and hurt we cling to, Love waits to heal us
so deeply that it seems the “problem” was never there, as though we
slept for a while, and dreamt dreams of loss, of weakness, of
unworthiness, of guilt, of shame, of unreality. What joy to awaken!

We *are* awakening. We – you and I and everyone – have been together as
long as time has been. We have dreamt together every dream unlike Love,
and the choiceless choice comes to present itself yet again. We are the
makers of the world we see, and this recognition can seem to paralyze
us, depress us, or immobilize us, until we realize that it is only an
expression of the thoughts we have insisted on maintaining as real! We
are free now, free to *choose again*.

Jeshua has been an enigma for 2,000 years. That is a long time to be
famous, especially without building an empire, writing any books, or
being allowed as a subject of study in public schools. The guy doesn’t
have any movie credits to his name, nor did He ever invent anything. But
He did accept the choiceless choice to *live* the reality of Love. And
that has made all the difference – for Him, and for everyone who has
ever opened their heart just a little to Him. He has often said that He
has waited long for *this* time to be present on the Earth. A time when a
timeless Truth can be breathed as an idea into minds and hearts, and
spread rapidly and completely around the world. I say “breathed” because
the time for dogma, for preaching, is behind us. To *breathe* the truth
first requires that we take it deeply into ourselves, literally with
every breath, then offer it to whoever is in front of us, literally with
each outward breath, as though bathing them in what is beyond words. We
can invite them, in an atmosphere of safety, to breathe with us. It can
become a circle, a dance, of receiving and giving, giving and receiving.
Are we willing to initiate such sharing?

When we make the choiceless choice for Love, right *here* and right *now*,
wherever we are, we join with others all over the world who are also
choosing to awaken. Our every loving gesture literally uplifts the
world, because it must necessarily affect the collective mind of
mankind.

One of my favorite quotes is from a Jewish teacher, Maimonidies. What he
asks is perhaps the only question we need answer. While it points to our
responsibility, it also points to the immeasurable power that lives
*equally* within each of us, and will shine forth as we unlearn our fear
of it. The question is this:

<p class="center indent">If not NOW, when?\
If not YOU, who?</p>

With Jeshua as loving brother and guide, we have learned that the
choiceless choice is the inevitable recognition that the *when* is now,
and the *who* is us. We have also learned that awakening is not about some
ephemeral aloofness masquerading as transcendence, in which every
challenge and every unwanted feeling is explained away as an illusion.
Rather, awakening is a *correction*, a wiping clean of the slate of
learned perceptions, so that life, which is but Love extending itself to
embrace creation, can finally be *lived* and not merely survived. It is
not an end, but a beginning. My friend, Michael Stillwater, calls it
“landing with your feet on the planet.”

“Beam me up, Scottie” is *not* what our gentle brother teaches, nor lives
for. Love does not seek escape, but serves. While the ego cries out,
“But what is in it for me?” the awakened heart asks simply, “How can I
help?”... then lets Love be the guide.

Alan Cohen wrote that “Jeshua would probably agree that we have had
enough students, and it is time for more masters.” I wholeheartedly
agree. He has never asked to be worshipped, only to be joined. Love will
prevail in the end, if only because it requires great energy to resist
it, and that resistance will finally exhaust itself. We learn either
through joy or through pain, but we *will* learn. The direction of the
wise choice seems obvious enough.

Jeshua once stopped me in my tracks by saying that “the truths of the
world are *diametrically opposed* to the Reality of the Kingdom.” That
means that everything we have been taught is the exact opposite of what
is real! The world has taught us that we must know where we are going
before starting the journey. We must know what we are going to get, how
it is going to affect us, and then decide whether or not to launch our
ship. We need to make sure we have our parachute in order before we
jump. *But exactly the opposite is true*!

I believe in you. I believe that you are intimately united with the
Source of Life, and that Life longs to be lived through *you*; that you
have every right to set aside the ways of this world, where the laws of
chaos, distrust, and fear seem to rule. If you jump, you will find your
parachute. To all of you who have jumped, and to the growing number of
us who are now moving to the edge, I extend our gratitude to you for
being willing to join with everyone now choosing to bring Heaven to
Earth.

Well, there. Now that it is 5 a.m., I can crawl back under the covers.
Something more needed to be shared to complete this book. I see now that
Jeshua, throughout *The Way of the Servant*, was both correcting our
collective misconceptions about who we really are, while also asking
Maimonides’ question. A question waits on an answer, and I could not let
this fourth edition go to press without answering it. Here, then, is my
final offering to you. May we join together to grow, heal, and push the
limits of awakening. May we join to envision a planet healed and a
humanity at peace, and to do all we can to share who we really are –
radical, ecstatic spirit – together with what we can discover that is
truly helpful with those who will be drawn to us!

<p class="quote">Heaven on Earth.</p>

Jeshua refers to this as the “adamic process”. ‘Dam’ in his native
Aramaic language, refers to nature, or the bodymind itself. ‘A’
(pronounced Aaahh) is the first letter of the name for God he used the
most: ‘Alaha’, and signifies the unlimited source we have come to call
“God”.

Thus, “a” seeks to penetrate, suffuse, and move through “dam”, as it
seeks in the great cycle of evolution to manifest what has not yet
completed its full birthing: “Adam” the ‘first man’ of the bible! For we
are all part of this great birthing as the fulness of real humanity.

<p class="quote">Can there be a greater adventure? \
Can there be anything more worthy of our being?</p>

Streams of joy!
