## Help Wanted

The Library has a feature where a transcript will be scrolled in sync
with the audio recording as it is playing. The paragraph spoken is
highlighted and scrolled into view.

This feature requires the capture of a time point that occurs between
paragraphs and is needed for all paragraphs in the transcript.

This is an easy task and support for capturing times is built into the
site. All you need to do is listen to the audio and click a large icon,
<i class="fa fa-bullseye"></i>, when the audio passes from one
paragraph to another. You can even do it in the <i class="fa
fa-coffee"></i> shop on your <i class="fa fa-mobile"></i> mobile device.

This is needed for both the *Way of Mastery* and the *Northwest
Foundation for ACIM* Study Group sessions.

Please let me know via the [<i class="fa fa-envelope-o"></i> contact
form](/about/#send-me-a-message) if you can help. Your help is *very
much* appreciated.
