## Teachings of Christ Mind

### Welcome

*Christ Mind* flows from a way of being that is Christ. It is a way of
living that was demonstrated by Jesus and others and expressed fully
by the quote:

> Not my will but thine be done.

There is a depth to these words that is revealed through deep self-honesty
and an acknowledgement of the wisdom found at the center of an open
heart and recognized by a mind at peace.

The Way of Christ is not a belief but a way of life that allows and
forgives and cultivates the recognition of innocense and safety in each
moment.

Christ Mind teachings guide and inspire such a life. They are not new
and have been expressed by many throughout human history. Few have given
themselves fully to living such a life yet this is changing and
changing rapidly. We are living in a time where the call to awaken is
being heard and embraced.

This site offers a small but growing collection of Christ Mind teachings
easily accessible and freely available. We hope you will find it helpful
on your journey and a source of inspiration and encouragement.
