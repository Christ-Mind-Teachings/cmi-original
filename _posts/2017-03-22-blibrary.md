## The Library

The library contains teachings that have a similar theme but can
differ in the way the ideas are expressed. Taken together, these
differences offer a more complete and well-rounded view of the material
expressed. It's very much like having the ability to walk around and
look at all aspects of a beautiful work of art instead of viewing it
from only one perspective.

Christ Mind teachings tend to 'sink in' over time and what was thought
to be fully understood is, six months later, seen in an entirely
different light. This is because, as it says in *A Course in Miracles*,
that:

> Words are symbols of symbols twice removed from Reality.

Words are important and are the way in which concepts are communicated
but the goal of Christ Mind teachings is not an understanding of the
words but an experience of the Reality they point to. In this way the
meaning of the words is *known* beyond concept and their truth apparent.

There are two sources of Christ Mind teachings in the library - which is
still under construction.

### [*The Way of Mastery*](/wom/intro/wom/)
{: .landing-h3}

The core teachings of the *Way of Mastery* are comprised of thirty five
sequential monthly sessions given by Jeshua, also known as Jesus,
over a three year period. Each year has a specific theme described by
the title:

- [*The Way of the Heart*](/wom/intro/woh/) - year one
- [*The Way of Transformation*](/wom/intro/wot/) - year two
- [*The Way of Knowing*](/wom/intro/wok/) - year three

The monthly lessons of *The Way of Mastery* present an ever deepening
pathway of awakening.

Channeled sessions given by Jeshua prior to the core teachings, called
[*The Early Years*](/wom/intro/early/), are also available here but
remain incomplete. The omitted sessions will be added to the library
over time.

[Q&A sessions](/wom/intro/questions/) occurring after a lesson are
included here and are also grouped together for easy reference.

Additionally, the original recording of each session is available along
side of transcript. Look for the <i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i> symbol.

### [Northwest Foundation for *ACIM*](/nwffacim/intro/nwffacim/)
