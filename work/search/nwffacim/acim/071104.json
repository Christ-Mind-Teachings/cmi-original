    "text": "when you attend college there are some courses that you take that have prerequisites which means theres another course or two that have to be taken first before you can take this course there are certain prerequisites that one must fulfill in order to get help theres actually only one prerequisite and that prerequisite is that you have to be willing to receive it simple if the asking for help has any other purpose if there is any other goal attached to the request for help dont take the bait and the moment you find out that there is some other motive behind the request for help the call for help disengage from the dynamic of the helping relationship be wise be clear and dont let guilt creep in to the embodiment of your clarity the actions that result from your clarity when you say no and mean it nothing will promote the end of illusion faster than withdrawal from participating in it nothing will dispel illusion faster than withdrawal from participating in it"
