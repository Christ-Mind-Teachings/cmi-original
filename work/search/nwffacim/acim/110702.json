    "text": "well when you read those words beautiful structures and you have just been talking about temples immediately gothic cathedrals modern cathedrals stained glass windows exquisite pipe organ pipes come to mind when its like hmmm how can that be a sign of the fear of atonement but if the body and im not going to come around and tap everyones knee again its a temple well it makes a lot more sense if you say the emphasis on beautiful bodies is a sign of the fear of atonement and an unwillingness to reach the altar itself its easier to see that a preoccupation with presenting a good human form is a good way of covering up your heart if youre connected to your heart you will be the presence of love unshaven hair unkempt not caring at all about a beautiful structure a beautiful presentation you see"
