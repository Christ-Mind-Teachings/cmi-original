    "text": "the attraction of guilt is found in sin not error sin will be repeated because of this attraction fear can become so acute that the sin is denied the acting out but while the guilt remains attractive the mind will suffer and not let go of the idea of sin for guilt still calls to it and the mind hears it and yearns for it making itself a willing captive to its sick appeal sin is an idea of evil that cannot be corrected and will be forever desirable as an essential part of what the ego thinks you are you will always want it and only an avenger with a mind unlike your own could stamp it out through fear"
