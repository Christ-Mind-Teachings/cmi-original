    "text": "how does one overcome illusions surely not by force or anger nor by opposing them in any way merely by letting reason tell you that they contradict reality they go against what must be true the opposition comes from them and not reality reality opposes nothing what merely is needs no defense and offers none only illusions need defense because of weakness and how can it be difficult to walk the way of truth when only weakness interferes you are the strong ones in this seeming conflict and you need no defense everything that needs defense you do not want for anything that needs defense will weaken you"
