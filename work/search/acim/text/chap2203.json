    "text": "a holy relationship however newly born must value holiness above all else unholy values will produce confusion and in awareness in an unholy relationship each one is valued because he seems to justify the others sin he sees within the other what impels him to sin against his will and thus he lays his sins upon the other and is attracted to him to perpetuate his sins and so it must become impossible for each to see himself as causing sin by his desire to have sin real yet reason sees a holy relationship as what it is a common state of mind where both give errors gladly to correction that both may happily be healed as one"
