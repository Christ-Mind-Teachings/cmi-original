    "text": "to heal is to make happy i have told you before to think how many opportunities you have to gladden yourselves and how many you have refused this is exactly the same as telling you that you have refused to heal yourselves the light that belongs to you is the light of joy radiance is not associated with sorrow depression is often contagious but although it may affect those who come in contact with it they do not yield to the influence whole heartedly but joy calls forth an integrated willingness to share in it and thus promotes the minds natural impulse to respond as one"

    "text": "those who attempt to heal without being wholly joyous themselves call forth different kinds of responses at the same time and thus deprive others of the joy of responding whole heartedly to be whole hearted you must be happy if fear and love cannot coexist and if it is impossible to be wholly fearful and remain alive then the only possible whole state is that of love there is no difference between love and joy therefore the only possible whole state is the wholly joyous to heal or to make joyous is therefore the same as to integrate and to make one that is why it makes no difference to what part or by what part of the sonship the healing is done every part benefits and benefits equally"
