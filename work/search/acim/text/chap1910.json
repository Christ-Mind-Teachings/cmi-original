    "text": "this is the darkest veil upheld by the belief in death and protected by its attraction the dedication to death and to its sovereignty is but the solemn vow the promise made in secret to the ego never to lift this veil not to approach it nor even to suspect that it is there this is the secret bargain made with the ego to keep what lies beyond the veil forever blotted out and unremembered here is your promise never to allow union to call you out of separation the great amnesia in which the memory of god seems quite forgotten the cleavage of your self from you the fear of god the final step in your dissociation"

    "text": "every obstacle that peace must flow across is surmounted in just the same way the fear that raised it yields to the love beneath and so the fear is gone and so it is with this the desire to get rid of peace and drive the holy spirit from you fades in the presence of the quiet recognition that you love him the exaltation of the body is given up in favor of the spirit which you love as you could never love the body and the appeal of death is lost forever as loves attraction stirs and calls to you from beyond each of the obstacles to love love itself has called and each has been surmounted by the power of the attraction of what lies beyond your wanting fear seemed to be holding them in place yet when you heard the voice of love beyond them you answered and they disappeared"
