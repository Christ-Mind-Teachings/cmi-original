    "text": "forgiveness is this worlds equivalent of heavens justice it translates the world of sin into a simple world where justice can be reflected from beyond the gate behind which total lack of limits lies nothing in boundless love could need forgiveness and what is charity within the world gives way to simple justice past the gate that opens into heaven no one forgives unless he has believed in sin and still believes that he has much to be forgiven forgiveness thus becomes the means by which he learns he has done nothing to forgive forgiveness always rests upon the one who offers it until he sees himself as needing it no more and thus is he returned to his real function of creating which his forgiveness offers him again"

    "text": "forgiveness turns the world of sin into a world of glory wonderful to see each flower shines in light and every bird sings of the joy of heaven there is no sadness and there is no parting here for everything is totally forgiven and what has been forgiven must join for nothing stands between to keep them separate and apart the sinless must perceive that they are one for nothing stands between to push the other off and in the space which sin left vacant do they join as one in gladness recognizing what is part of them has not been kept apart and separate"

    "text": "forgiveness brings no little miracles to lay before the gate of heaven here the son of god himself comes to receive each gift that brings him nearer to his home not one is lost and none is cherished more than any other each reminds him of his fathers love as surely as the rest and each one teaches him that what he feared he loves the most what but a miracle could change his mind so that he understands that love cannot be feared what other miracle is there but this and what else need there be to make the space between you disappear"

    "text": "where sin once was perceived will rise a world which will become an altar to the truth and you will join the lights of heaven there and sing their song of gratitude and praise and as they come to you to be complete so will you go with them for no one hears the song of heaven and remains without a voice that adds its power to the song and makes it sweeter still and each one joins the singing at the altar which was raised within the tiny spot that sin proclaimed to be its own and what was tiny then has soared into a magnitude of song in which the universe has joined with but a single voice this tiny spot of sin that stands between you still is holding back the happy opening of heavens gate how little is the hindrance which withholds the wealth of heaven from you and how great will be the joy in heaven when you join the mighty chorus to the love of god"
