    "text": "the grace of god rests gently on forgiving eyes and everything they look on speaks of him to the beholder he can see no evil nothing in the world to fear and no one who is different from himself and as he loves them so he looks upon himself with love and gentleness he would no more condemn himself for his mistakes than damn another he is not an arbiter of vengeance nor a punisher of sin the kindness of his sight rests on himself with all the tenderness it offers others for he would only heal and only bless and being in accord with what god wills he has the power to heal and bless all those he looks on with the grace of god upon his sight"

    "text": "eyes become used to darkness and the light of brilliant day seems painful to the eyes grown long accustomed to the dim effects perceived at twilight and they turn away from sunlight and the clarity it brings to what they look upon dimness seems better easier to see and better recognized somehow the vague and more obscure seems easier to look upon less painful to the eyes than what is wholly clear and unambiguous yet this is not what eyes are for and who can say that he prefers the darkness and maintain he wants to see the wish to see calls down the grace of god upon your eyes and brings the gift of light that makes sight possible"
