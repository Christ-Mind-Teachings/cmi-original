    "text": "it should be clear by now that while the content of any particular ego illusion does not matter it is usually more helpful to correct it in a specific context ego illusions are quite specific although they frequently change and although the mind is naturally abstract the mind nevertheless becomes concrete voluntarily as soon as it splits however only part of it splits so only part of it is concrete the concrete part is the same part that believes in the ego because the ego depends on the specific it is the part that believes your existence means you are separate"

    "text": "everything the ego perceives is a separate whole without the relationships that imply being the ego is thus against communication except in so far as it is utilized to establish separateness rather than to abolish it the communication system of the ego is based on its own thought system as is everything else it dictates its communication is controlled by its need to protect itself and it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat while this is always so individual egos perceive different kinds of threat which are quite specific in their own judgement for example although all forms of perceived demands may be classified or judged by the ego as coercive communication which must be disrupted the response of breaking communication will nevertheless be to a specific person or persons"

    "text": "the specificity of the egos thinking then results in a spurious kind of generalization which is really not abstract at all it will respond in certain specific ways to all stimuli which it perceives as related in contrast the soul reacts in the same way to everything it knows is true and does not respond at all to anything else nor does it make any attempt to establish what is true it knows that what is true is everything that god created it is in complete and direct communication with every aspect of creation because it is in complete and direct communication with its creator"
