    "text": "the practical application of the holy spirits purpose is extremely simple but it is unequivocal in fact in order to be simple it must be unequivocal the simple is merely what is easily understood and for this it is apparent that it must be clear the setting of the holy spirits goal is general now he will work with you to make it specific there are certain very specific guidelines he provides for any situation but remember that you do not yet realize their universal application therefore it is essential at this point to use them in each situation separately until you can more safely look beyond each situation in an understanding far broader than you now possess"
