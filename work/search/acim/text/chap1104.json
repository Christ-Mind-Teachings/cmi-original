    "text": "the ego is certain that love is dangerous and this is always its central teaching it never puts it this way on the contrary everyone who believes that the ego is salvation is intensely engaged in the search for love yet the ego though encouraging the search very actively makes one proviso do not find it its dictates then can be summed up simply as seek and do not find this is the one promise the ego holds out to you and the one promise it will keep for the ego pursues its goal with fanatic insistence and its reality testing though severely impaired is completely consistent"

    "text": "the search which the ego undertakes is therefore bound to be defeated and since it also teaches that it is your identification its guidance leads you to a journey which must end in perceived self defeat for the ego cannot love and in its frantic search for love it is seeking what it is afraid to find the search is inevitable because the ego is part of your mind and because of its source the ego is not wholly split off or it could not be believed at all for it is your mind that believes in it and gives existence to it yet it is also your mind that has the power to deny the egos existence and you will surely do so when you realize exactly what the journey is on which the ego sets you"
