    "text": "specialness is a lack of trust in anyone except yourself faith is invested in yourself alone everything else becomes your enemy feared and attacked deadly and dangerous hated and worthy only of destruction whatever gentleness it offers is but deception but its hate is real in danger of destruction it must kill and you are drawn to it to kill it first and such is guilts attraction here is death enthroned as savior crucifixion is now redemption and salvation can only mean destruction of the world except yourself"

    "text": "you can but hurt yourself this has been oft repeated but is difficult to grasp as yet to minds intent on specialness it is impossible yet to those who wish to heal and not attack it is quite obvious the purpose of attack is in the mind and its effects are felt but where it is nor is mind limited so must it be that harmful purpose hurts the mind as one nothing could make less sense to specialness nothing could make more sense to miracles for miracles are merely change of purpose from hurt to healing"
