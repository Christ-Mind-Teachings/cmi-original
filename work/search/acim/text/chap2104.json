    "text": "the holy spirit will never teach you that you are sinful errors he will correct but this makes no one fearful you are indeed afraid to look within and see the sin you think is there this you would not be fearful to admit fear in association with sin the ego deems quite appropriate and smiles approvingly it has no fear to let you feel ashamed it doubts not your belief and faith in sin its temples do not shake because of this your faith that sin is there but witnesses to your desire that it be there to see this merely seems to be the source of fear"
