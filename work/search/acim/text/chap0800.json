    "text": "you are hampered in your progress by your demands to know what you do not know this is actually a way of holding on to deprivation you cannot reasonably object to following instructions in a course for knowing on the grounds that you do not know the need for the course is implicit in your objection knowledge is not the motivation for learning this course peace is as the prerequisite for knowledge peace must be learned this is only because those who are in conflict are not peaceful and peace is the condition of knowledge because it is the condition of the kingdom"

    "text": "knowledge will be restored when you meet its conditions this is not a bargain made by godwho makes no bargains it is merely the result of your misuse of his laws on behalf of a will that is not his knowledge is his will if you are opposing his will how can you have knowledge i have told you what knowledge offers you but it is clear that you do not regard this as wholly desirable if you did you would hardly be willing to throw it away so readily when the ego asks for your allegiance the distraction of the ego seems to interfere with your learning but the ego has no power to distract you unless you give it the power"

    "text": "the egos voice is a hallucination you cannot expect it to say i am not real hallucinations are inaccurate perceptions of reality yet you are not asked to dispel them alone you are merely asked to evaluate them in terms of their results to you if you do not want them on the basis of loss of peace they will be removed from your mind for you every response to the ego is a call to war and war does deprive you of peace yet in this war there is no opponent this is the reinterpretation of reality which you must make to secure peace and the only one you need ever make"
