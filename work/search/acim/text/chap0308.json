    "text": "every system of thought must have a starting point it begins with either a making or a creating a difference which we have discussed already their resemblance lies in their power as foundations their difference lies in what rests upon them both are cornerstones for systems of belief by which men live it is a mistake to believe that a thought system which is based on lies is weak nothing made by a child of god is without power it is essential to realize this because otherwise you will not understand why you have so much trouble with this course and will be unable to escape from the prisons which you have made for yourselves"

    "text": "eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is a symbolic expression for incorporating into the self the ability for self creating this is the only sense in which god and his souls are not co creators the belief that they are is implicit in the self concept a concept now made acceptable by its weakness and explained by a tendency of the self to create an image of itself its fear aspect is often ascribed to fear of retaliation by a father figure a particularly curious idea in view of the fact that no one uses the term to refer to the physical father it refers to an image of a father in relation to an image of the self"
