    "text": "the holy relationship is the expression of the holy instant in living in this world like everything about salvation the holy instant is a practical device witnessed to by its results the holy instant never fails the experience of it is always felt yet without expression it is not remembered the holy relationship is a constant reminder of the experience in which the relationship became what it is and as the unholy relationship is a continuing hymn of hate in praise of its maker so is the holy relationship a happy song of praise to the redeemer of relationships"

    "text": "this invitation is accepted immediately and the holy spirit wastes no time in introducing the practical results of asking him to enter at once his goal replaces yours this is accomplished very rapidly but it makes the relationship seem disturbed disjunctive and even quite distressing the reason is quite clear for the relationship as it is is out of line with its own goal and clearly unsuited to the purpose which has been accepted for it in its unholy condition your goal was all that seemed to give it meaning now it seems to make no sense many relationships have been broken off at this point and the pursuit of the old goal re established in another relationship for once the unholy relationship has accepted the goal of holiness it can never again be what it was"
