    "text": "the abilities man now possesses are only shadows of his real strengths all of his functions are equivocal and open to question or doubt this is because he is not certain how he will use them he is therefore incapable of knowledge being uncertain he is also incapable of knowledge because he can perceive lovelessly he cannot create surely because his perception deceives perception did not exist until the separation had introduced degrees aspects and intervals the soul has no levels and all conflict arises from the concept of levels only the levels of the trinity are capable of unity the levels which man created by the separation cannot but conflict this is because they are essentially meaningless to each other"
