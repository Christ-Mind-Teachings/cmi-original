    "text": "it is essential that error be not confused with sin and it is this distinction which makes salvation possible for error can be corrected and the wrong made right but sin were it possible would be irreversible the belief in sin is necessarily based on the firm conviction that minds not bodies can attack and thus the mind is guilty and will forever so remain unless a mind not part of it can give it absolution sin calls for punishment as error for correction and the belief that punishment is correction is clearly insane"
