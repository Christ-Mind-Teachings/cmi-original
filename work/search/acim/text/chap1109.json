    "text": "if you did not feel guilty you could not attack for condemnation is the root of attack it is the judgement of one mind by another as unworthy of love and deserving of punishment but herein lies the split for the mind that judges perceives itself as separate from the mind being judged believing that by punishing another it will escape punishment all this is but the delusional attempt of the mind to deny itself and escape the penalty of denial it is not an attempt to relinquish denial but to hold on to it for it is guilt that has obscured the father to you and it is guilt that has driven you insane"
