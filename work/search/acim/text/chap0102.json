    "text": "you are involved in unconscious distortions which are producing a dense cover over miracle impulses and which make it hard for them to reach consciousness the nature of any interpersonal relationship is limited or defined by what you want it to do relating is a way of achieving an outcome the danger of defenses lies in their propensity for holding misperceptions rigidly in place all actions which stem from reverse thinking are literally the behavioral expressions of those who know not what they do a rigid orientation can be extremely reliable even if it is upside down in fact the more consistently upside down it is the more reliable it is"

    "text": "however validity is still the ultimate goal which reliability can only serve hostility triumph vengeance self debasement and all kinds of expressions of lack of love are often very clearly seen in the fantasies which accompany them but it is a profound error to imagine that because these fantasies are so frequent or occur so reliably that this implies validity remember that while validity implies reliability the relationship is not reversible you can be wholly reliable and entirely wrong while a reliable instrument does measure something what use is it unless you discover what the something is this course then will concentrate on validity and let reliability fall naturally into place"

    "text": "the confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is a major source of perceptual distortion because it induces rather than straightens out the basic level confusion which underlies the perception of all those who seek happiness with the instruments of this world inappropriate physical impulses or misdirected miracle impulses result in conscious guilt if expressed and depression if denied all real pleasure comes from doing gods will this is because not doing it is a denial of self denial of error results in projection correction of error brings release lead us not into temptation means do not let us deceive ourselves into believing that we can relate in peace to god or to our brothers with anything external"

    "text": "fantasies of any kind are distorted forms of thinking because they always involve twisting perception into unreality fantasy is a debased form of vision vision and revelation are closely related while fantasy and projection are more closely associated because both attempt to control external reality according to false internal needs twist reality in any way and you are perceiving destructively reality was lost through usurpation which in turn produced tyranny i told you that you are now restored to your former role in the plan of atonement but you must still choose freely to devote yourselves to the greater restoration as long as a single slave remains to walk the earth your release is not complete complete restoration of the sonship is the only true goal of the miracle minded"

    "text": "no fantasies are true they are distortions of perception by definition they are a means of making false associations and obtaining pleasure from them man can do this only because he is creative but although he can perceive false associations he can never make them real except to himself man believes in what he creates if he creates miracles he will be equally strong in his belief in them the strength of his conviction will then sustain the belief of the miracle receiver and fantasies become totally unnecessary as the wholly satisfying nature of reality becomes apparent to both"
