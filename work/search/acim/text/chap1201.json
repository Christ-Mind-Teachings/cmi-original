    "text": "the darkest of your hidden cornerstones holds your belief in guilt from your awareness for in that dark and secret place is the realization that you have betrayed gods son by condemning him to death you do not even suspect this murderous but insane idea lies hidden there for the egos destructive urge is so intense that nothing short of the crucifixion of gods son can ultimately satisfy it it does not know who the son of god is because it is blind yet let it perceive guiltlessness anywhere and it will try to destroy it because it is afraid"

    "text": "much of the egos strange behavior is directly attributable to its definition of guilt to the ego the guiltless are guilty those who do not attack are its enemies because by not valuing its interpretation of salvation they are in an excellent position to let it go they have approached the darkest and deepest cornerstone in the egos foundation and while the ego can withstand your raising all else to question it guards this one secret with its life for its existence does depend on keeping this secret so it is this secret that we must look upon calmly for the ego cannot protect you against truth and in its presence the ego is dispelled"

    "text": "we once said that the crucifixion is the symbol of the ego when it was confronted with the real guiltlessness of gods son it did attempt to kill him and the reason it gave was that guiltlessness is blasphemous to god to the ego the ego is god and guiltlessness must be interpreted as the final guilt which fully justifies murder you do not yet understand that all your fear of this course stems ultimately from this interpretation but if you will consider your reactions to it you will become increasingly convinced that this is so"
