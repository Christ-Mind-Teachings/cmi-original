    "text": "all separation vanishes as holiness is shared for holiness is power and by sharing it it gains in strength if you seek for satisfaction in gratifying your needs as you perceive them you must believe that strength comes from another and what you gain he loses someone must always lose if you perceive yourself as weak yet there is another interpretation of relationships which transcends the concept of loss of power completely"
