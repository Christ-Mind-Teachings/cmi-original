    "text": "the journey that we undertake together is the exchange of dark for light of ignorance for understanding nothing you understand is fearful it is only in darkness and in ignorance that you perceive the frightening and you shrink away from it to further darkness and yet it is only the hidden that can terrify not for what it is but for its hiddenness the obscure is frightening because you do not understand its meaning if you did it would be clear and you would be no longer in the dark nothing has hidden value for what is hidden cannot be shared and so its value is unknown the hidden is kept apart but value always lies in joint appreciation what is concealed cannot be loved and so it must be feared"
