    "text": "the last judgement is one of the greatest threat concepts in mans perception this is only because he does not understand it judgement is not an essential attribute of god man brought judgement into being only because of the separation after the separation however there was a place for judgement as one of the many learning devices which had to be built into the overall plan just as the separation occurred over many millions of years the last judgement will extend over a similarly long period and perhaps an even longer one its length depends however on the effectiveness of the present speed up"
