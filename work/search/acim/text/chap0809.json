    "text": "fear of the will of god is one of the strangest beliefs that the human mind has ever made this could not possibly have occurred unless the mind were already profoundly split making it possible for the mind to be afraid of what it really is it is apparent that reality cannot threaten anything except illusions since reality can only uphold truth the very fact that the will of god which is what you are is perceived as fearful to you demonstrates that you are afraid of what you are it is not then the will of god of which you are afraid but yours your will is not the egos and that is why the ego is against you what seems to be the fear of god is really only the fear of your own reality"
