    "text": "this is a course in mind training all learning involves attention and study at some level some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their study you will also need them for preparation without this you may become much too fearful when the unexpected does occur to make constructive use of it however as you study these earlier sections you will begin to see some of their implications which will be amplified considerably later on"

    "text": "the reason a solid foundation is necessary is because of the confusion between fear and awe to which we have already referred and which so many people hold you will remember that we said that awe is inappropriate in connection with the sons of god because you should not experience awe in the presence of your equals however it was also emphasized that awe is a proper reaction in the presence of your creator i have been careful to clarify my own role in the atonement without either over or understating it i have also tried to do the same in connection with yours i have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me because of my inherent equality"
