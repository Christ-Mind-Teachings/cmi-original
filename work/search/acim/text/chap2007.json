    "text": "we have said much about discrepancies of means and end and how these must be brought in line before your holy relationship can bring you only joy but we have also said the means to meet the holy spirits goal will come from the same source as does his purpose being so simple and direct this course has nothing in it that is not consistent the seeming inconsistencies or parts you find more difficult than others are merely indications of areas where means and end are still discrepant and this produces great discomfort this need not be this course requires almost nothing of you it is impossible to imagine one that asks so little or could offer more"
