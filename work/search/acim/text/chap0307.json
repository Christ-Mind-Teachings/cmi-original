    "text": "we have already discussed the last judgement in some though insufficient detail after the last judgement there will be no more this is symbolic only in the sense that everyone is much better off without judgement when the bible says judge not that ye be not judged it merely means that if you judge the reality of others at all you will be unable to avoid judging your own the choice to judge rather than to know was the cause of the loss of peace judgement is the process on which perception but not cognition rests we have discussed this before in terms of the selectivity of perception pointing out that evaluation is its obvious prerequisite"

    "text": "judgement always involves rejection it is not an ability which emphasizes only the positive aspects of what is judged whether it be in or out of the self however what has been perceived and rejected or judged and found wanting remains in the unconscious because it has been perceived one of the illusions from which man suffers is the belief that what he judged against has no effect this cannot be true unless he also believes that what he judged against does not exist he evidently does not believe this or he would not have judged against it it does not matter in the end whether you judge right or wrong either way you are placing your belief in the unreal this cannot be avoided in any type of judgement because it implies the belief that reality is yours to choose from"
