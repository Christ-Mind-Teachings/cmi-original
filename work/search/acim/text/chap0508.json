    "text": "the idea of set is among the better psychological concepts actually it is used quite frequently in the bible and also in this course under many different terms for examplegod will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed or set on him a statement which means that gods peace is set in the holy spirit because it is fixed on god it is also fixed in you you then are fixed in the peace of god the concept of fixation is also a very helpful one which freud understood perfectly unfortunately he lost his understanding because he was afraid and as you know all too well fear is incompatible with good judgement fear distorts thinking and therefore disorders thought"
