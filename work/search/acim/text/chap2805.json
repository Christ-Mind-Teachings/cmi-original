    "text": "it is the sharing of the evil dreams of hate and malice bitterness and death of sin and suffering and pain and loss that makes them real unshared they are perceived as meaningless the fear is gone from them because you did not give them your support where fear has gone there love must come because there are but these alternatives where one appears the other disappears and which you share becomes the only one you have you have the one which you accept because it is the only one you wish to have you share no evil dreams if you forgive the dreamer and perceive that he is not the dream he made and so he cannot be a part of yours from which you both are free forgiveness separates the dreamer from the evil dream and thus releases him"
