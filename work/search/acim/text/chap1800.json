    "text": "to substitute is to accept instead if you would but consider exactly what this entails you would perceive at once how much at variance this is with the goal the holy spirit has given you and would accomplish for you to substitute is to choose between renouncing one in favor of the other for this special purpose one is judged more valuable and the other is replaced by him the relationship in which the substitution occurred is thus fragmented and its purpose split accordingly to fragment is to exclude and substitution is the strongest defense the ego has for separation"

    "text": "the holy spirit never uses substitutes where the ego perceives one person as a replacement for another the holy spirit sees them joined and indivisible he does not judge between them knowing they are one being united they are one because they are the same substitution is clearly a process in which they are perceived as different one would unite the other separate nothing can come between what god has joined and what the holy spirit sees as one but everything seems to come between the fragmented relationships the ego sponsors to destroy"

    "text": "the one emotion in which substitution is impossible is love fear involves substitution by definition for it is loves replacement fear is both a fragmented and a fragmenting emotion it seems to take many forms and each seems to require a different form of acting out for satisfaction while this appears to introduce quite variable behavior a far more serious effect lies in the fragmented perception from which the behavior stems no one is seen complete the body is emphasized with special emphasis on certain parts and used as the standard for comparison for either acceptance or rejection of suitability for acting out a special form of fear"
