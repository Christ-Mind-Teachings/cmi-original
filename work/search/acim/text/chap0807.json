    "text": "the reason why definitions in terms of function are inferior is that they may well be inaccurate functions are part of being since they arise from it but the relationship is not reciprocal the whole does define the part but the part does not define the whole this is as true of knowledge as it is of perception the reason to know in part is to know entirely is because of the fundamental difference between knowledge and perception in perception the whole is built up of parts which can separate and reassemble in different constellations knowledge never changes so its constellation is permanent the only areas in which part whole relationships have any meaning are those in which change is possible there is no difference between the whole and the part where change is impossible"
