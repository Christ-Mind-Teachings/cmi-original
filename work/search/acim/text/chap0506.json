    "text": "perhaps some of our concepts will become clearer and more personally meaningful if the egos use of guilt is clarified the ego has a purpose just as the holy spirit has the egos purpose is fear because only the fearful can be egotistic the egos logic is as impeccable as that of the holy spirit because your mind has all the means at its disposal to side with heaven or earth as it elects but again let us remember that both are in you in heaven there is no guilt because the kingdom is attained through the atonement which releases you to create the word create is appropriate here because once what you have made is undone by the holy spirit the blessed residue is restored and therefore continues in creation what is truly blessed is incapable of giving rise to guilt and"
