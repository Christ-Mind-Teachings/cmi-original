    "text": "the holiness of your relationship forgives you both undoing the effects of what you both believed and saw and with their going is the need for sin gone with them who has need for sin only the lonely and alone who see their brothers different from themselves it is this difference seen but not real that makes the need for sin not real but seen seem justified and all this would be real if sin were so for an unholy relationship is based on differences where each one thinks the other has what he has not they come together each to complete himself and rob the other they stay until they think theres nothing left to steal and then move on and so they wander through a world of strangers unlike themselves living with their bodies perhaps under a common roof that shelters neither in the same room and yet a world apart"

    "text": "a holy relationship starts from a different premise each one has looked within and seen no lack accepting his completion he would extend it by joining with another whole as himself he sees no difference between these selves for differences are only of the body therefore he looks on nothing he would take he denies not his own reality because it is the truth just under heaven does he stand but close enough not to return to earth for this relationship has heavens holiness how far from home can a relationship so like to heaven be"

    "text": "think what a holy relationship can teach here is belief in differences undone here is the faith in differences shifted to sameness and reason now can lead you to the logical conclusion of your union it must extend as you extended when you joined it must reach out beyond itself as you reached out beyond the body to let yourselves be joined and now the sameness which you saw extends and finally removes all sense of differences so that the sameness that lies beneath them all becomes apparent here is the golden circle where you recognize the son of god for what is born into a holy relationship can never end"
