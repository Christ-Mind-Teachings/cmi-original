    "text": "the egos plan for forgiveness is far more widely used than gods this is because it is undertaken by unhealed healers and is therefore of the ego let us consider the unhealed healer more carefully now by definition he is trying to give what he has not received if he is a theologian he may begin with the premise i am a miserable sinner and so are you if he is a psychotherapist he is more likely to start with the equally incredible idea that he really believes in attack and so does the patient but it does not matter in either case"

    "text": "all unhealed healers follow the egos plan for forgiveness in one form or another if they are theologians they are likely to condemn themselves teach condemnation and advocate a very fearful solution projecting condemnation onto god they make him appear retaliative and fear his retribution what they have done is merely to identify with the ego and by perceiving clearly what it does condemn themselves because of this profound confusion it is understandable that there has been a revolt against this concept but to revolt against it is still to believe in it the form of the revolt then is different but not the content"

    "text": "the newer forms of the egos plan are as unhelpful as the older ones because form does not matter to the holy spirit and therefore does not matter at all according to the newer forms of the egos plan the therapist interprets the egos symbols in the nightmare and then uses them to prove that the nightmare is real having made it real he then attempts to dispel its effects by depreciating the importance of the dreamer this would be a healing approach if the dreamer were properly identified as unreal yet if the dreamer is equated with the mind the minds corrective power through the holy spirit is denied"
