    "text": "in this world gods son comes closest to himself in a holy relationship there he begins to find the certainty his father has in him and there he finds his function of restoring his fathers laws to what was held outside them and finding what was lost only in time can anything be lost and never lost forever so do the parts of gods son gradually join in time and with each joining is the end of time brought nearer each miracle of joining is a mighty herald of eternity no one who has a single purpose unified and sure can be afraid no one who shares his purpose with him can not be one with him"
