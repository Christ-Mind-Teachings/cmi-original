    "text": "we have used many words as synonymous which are not ordinarily regarded as the same we began with having and being and more recently have used others hearing and being are examples to which we can also add teaching and being learning and being and above all projecting and being this is because as we have said before every idea begins in the mind of the thinker and extends outward therefore what extends from the mind is still in it and from what it extends it knows itself that is its natural talent the word knows is correct here even though the ego does not know and is not concerned with being at all"
