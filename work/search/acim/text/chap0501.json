    "text": "healing is an act of thought by which two minds perceive their oneness and become glad this gladness calls to every part of the sonship to rejoice with them and lets god himself go out into them and through them only the healed mind can experience revelation with lasting effect because revelation is an experience of pure joy if you do not choose to be wholly joyous your mind cannot have what it does not choose to be remember that the soul knows no difference between being and having the higher mind thinks according to the laws which the soul obeys and therefore honors only the laws of god to him getting is meaningless and giving is all having everything the soul holds everything by giving it and thus creates as the father created"
