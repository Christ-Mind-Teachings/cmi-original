    "text": "it cannot be emphasized too often that correcting perception is merely a temporary expedient it is necessary to do so only because misperception is a block to knowledge while accurate perception is a stepping stone towards it the whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable judgement which it entails that it is unnecessary this removes the block entirely you may ask how this is possible as long as you appear to be living in this world and since this is a sensible question it has a sensible answer you must be careful however that you really understand the question what is the you who are living in this world"
