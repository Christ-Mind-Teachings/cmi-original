    "text": "the meaning of the son of god lies solely in his relationship with his creator if it were elsewhere it would rest upon contingency but there is nothing else and this is wholly loving and forever yet has the son of god invented an unholy relationship between him and his father his real relationship is one of perfect union and unbroken continuity the one he made is partial self centered broken into fragments and full of fear the one created by his father is wholly self encompassing and self extending the one he made is wholly self destructive and self limiting"

    "text": "nothing can show the contrast better than the experience of both a holy and an unholy relationship the first is based on love and rests on it serene and undisturbed the body does not intrude upon it any relationship in which the body enters is based not on love but on idolatry love wishes to be known completely understood and shared it has no secrets nothing that it would keep apart and hide it walks in sunlight open eyed and calm in smiling welcome and in sincerity so simple and so obvious it cannot be misunderstood but idols do not share"

    "text": "love has no darkened temples where mysteries are kept obscure and hidden from the sun it does not seek for power but for relationships the body is the egos chosen weapon for seeking power through relationships and its relationships must be unholy for what they are it does not even see it wants them solely for the offerings on which its idols thrive the rest it merely throws away for all that it could offer is seen as valueless homeless the ego seeks as many bodies as it can collect to place its idols in and so establish them as temples to itself"
