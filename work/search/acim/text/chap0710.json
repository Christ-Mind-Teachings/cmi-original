    "text": "you no more recognize what is painful than you know what is joyful and are in fact very apt to confuse the two the holy spirits main function is to teach you to tell them apart however strange it may seem that this is necessary it obviously is the reason is equally obvious what is joyful to you is painful to the ego and as long as you are in doubt about what you are you will be confused about joy and pain this confusion is the cause of the whole idea of sacrifice obey the holy spirit and you will be giving up the ego but you will be sacrificing nothing on the contrary you will be gaining everything if you believed this there would be no conflict"
