    "text": "we once said that without projection there can be no anger but it is also true that without projection there can be no love projection is a fundamental law of the mind and therefore one which always operates it is the law by which you create and were created it is the law which unifies the kingdom and keeps it in the mind of god to the ego the law is perceived as a way of getting rid of something it does not want to the holy spirit it is the fundamental law of sharing by which you give what you value in order to keep it in your own mind"
