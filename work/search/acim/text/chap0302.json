    "text": "there is another point which must be perfectly clear before any residual fear which may still be associated with miracles becomes entirely groundless the crucifixion did not establish the atonement the resurrection did this is a point which many very sincere christians have misunderstood no one who is free of the scarcity error could possibly make this mistake if the crucifixion is seen from an upside down point of view it does appear as if god permitted and even encouraged one of his sons to suffer because he was good many ministers preach this every day"
