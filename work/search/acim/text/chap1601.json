    "text": "true empathy is of him who knows what it is you will learn his interpretation of it if you let him use your capacity for strength and not for weakness he will not desert you but be sure that you desert not him humility is strength in this sense only to recognize and accept the fact that you do not know is to recognize and accept the fact that he does know you are not sure that he will do his part because you have never yet done yours completely you will not know how to respond to what you do not understand be tempted not in this and yield not to the egos triumphant use of empathy for its glory"

    "text": "the meaning of love is lost in any relationship which looks to weakness and hopes to find love there the power of love which is its meaning lies in the strength of god which hovers over it and blesses it silently by enveloping it in healing wings let this be and do not try to substitute your miracle for this we once said that if a brother asks a foolish thing of you to do it but be certain that this does not mean to do a foolish thing that would hurt either him or you for what would hurt one will hurt the other foolish requests are foolish for the simple reason that they conflict because they contain an element of specialness only the holy spirit recognizes foolish needs as well as real ones and he will teach you how to meet both without losing either"
