    "text": "the bible says that you should go with a brother twice as far as he asks it certainly does not suggest that you set him back on his journey devotion to a brother cannot set you back either it can lead only to mutual progress the result of genuine devotion is inspiration a word which properly understood is the opposite of fatigue to be fatigued is to be dis spirited but to be inspired is to be in the spirit to be egocentric is to be dispirited but to be self centered in the right sense is to be inspired or in the soul the truly inspired are enlightened and cannot abide in darkness"

    "text": "you can speak from the soul or from the ego precisely as you choose if you speak from the soul you have chosen to be still and know that i am god these words are inspired because they come from knowledge if you speak from the ego you are disclaiming knowledge instead of affirming it and are thus dispiriting yourself do not embark on foolish journeys because they are indeed in vain the ego may desire them but the soul cannot embark on them because it is forever unwilling to depart from its foundation"

    "text": "repetition compulsions can be endless unless they are given up by an act of will do not make the pathetic human error of clinging to the old rugged cross the only message of the crucifixion was that we can overcome the cross unless you do so you are free to crucify yourself as often as you choose but this is not the gospel i intended to offer you we have another journey to undertake and if you will read these lessons carefully they will help to prepare you to undertake it"
