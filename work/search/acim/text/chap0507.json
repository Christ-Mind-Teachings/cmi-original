    "text": "the continuing will to remain separated is the only possible reason for continuing guilt feelings we have said this before but we did not emphasize the destructive results of this decision at that time any decision of the mind will affect both behavior and experience what you will you expect this is not delusional your mind does create your future and it can turn it back to full creation at any minute if it accepts the atonement first it will also turn back to full creation the instant it has done so having given up its thought disorder the proper ordering of thought becomes quite apparent"
