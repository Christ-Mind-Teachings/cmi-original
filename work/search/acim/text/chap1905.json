    "text": "the attraction of guilt produces fear of love for love would never look on guilt at all it is the nature of love to look upon only the truth for there it sees itself with which it would unite in holy union and completion as love must look past fear so must fear see love not for love contains the end of guilt as surely as fear depends on it overlooking guilt completely it sees no fear being wholly without attack it could not be afraid fear is attracted to what love sees not and each believes that what the other looks upon does not exist fear looks on guilt with just the same devotion that love looks on itself and each has messengers which they send forth and which return to them with messages written in the language in which their going forth was asked"

    "text": "the fierce attraction which guilt holds for fear is wholly absent from loves gentle perception what love would look upon is meaningless to fear and quite invisible relationships in this world are the result of how the world is seen and this depends on which emotion was called on to send its messengers to look upon it and return with word of what they saw fears messengers are trained through terror and they tremble when their master calls upon them to serve him for fear is merciless even to its friends its messengers steal guiltily away in hungry search of guilt for they are kept cold and starving and made very vicious by their master who allows them to feast only upon what they return to him no little shred of guilt escapes their hungry eyes and in their savage search for sin they pounce on any living thing they see and carry it screaming to their master to be devoured"
