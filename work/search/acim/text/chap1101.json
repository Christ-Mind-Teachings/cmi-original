    "text": "by applying the holy spirits interpretation of the reactions of others more and more consistently you will gain an increasing awareness that his criteria are equally applicable to you for to recognize fear is not enough to escape from it although the recognition is necessary to demonstrate the need for escape the holy spirit must still translate it into truth if you were left with the fear having recognized it you would have taken a step away from reality not towards it yet we have repeatedly emphasized the need to recognize fear and face it without disguise as a crucial step in the undoing of the ego consider how well the holy spirits interpretation of the motives of others will serve you then"
