    "text": "the clearest proof that empathy as the ego uses it is destructive lies in the fact that it is applied only to certain types of problems and in certain people these it selects out and joins with and it never joins except to strengthen itself make no mistake about this maneuver the ego always empathizes to weaken and to weaken is always to attack you do not know what empathizing means yet of this you may be sure if you will merely sit quietly by and let the holy spirit relate through you you will empathize with strength and both of you will gain in strength and not in weakness"
