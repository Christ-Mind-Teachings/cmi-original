    "text": "all therapy is release from the past that is why the holy spirit is the only therapist he teaches that the past does not exist a fact which belongs to the sphere of knowledge and which therefore no one in the world knows it would indeed be impossible to be in the world with this knowledge for the mind that knows this unequivocally knows also that it dwells in eternity and utilizes no perception at all it therefore does not consider where it is because the concept where does not mean anything to it it knows that it is everywhere just as it has everything and forever"
