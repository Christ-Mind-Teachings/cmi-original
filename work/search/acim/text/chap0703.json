    "text": "the results of such tests are evaluated relatively assuming maximal motivation but this is because we are dealing with abilities where degree of development is meaningful this does not mean that what the ability is used for is necessarily either limited or divided yet one thing is certain abilities are potentials for learning and you will apply them to what you want to learn learning is effort and effort means will we have used the term abilities in the plural because abilities began with the ego which perceived them as potentials for excelling this is how the ego still perceives them and uses them"

    "text": "you made the effort to learn and the holy spirit has a unified goal for all effort he adapts the egos potentials for excelling to potentials for equalizing this makes them useless for the egos purpose but very useful for his if different abilities are applied long enough to one goal the abilities themselves become unified this is because they are channelized in one direction or in one way ultimately then they all contribute to one result and by so doing their similarity rather than their differences is emphasized you can excel in many different ways but you can equalize in one way only equality is not a variable state by definition"
