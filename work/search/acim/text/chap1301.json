    "text": "perfect perception then has many elements in common with knowledge making transfer to it possible yet the last step must be taken by god because the last step in your redemption which seems to be in the future was accomplished by god in your creation the separation has not interrupted it creation cannot be interrupted the separation is merely a faulty formulation of reality with no effect at all the miracle without a function in heaven is needful here aspects of reality can still be seen and they will replace aspects of unreality aspects of reality can be seen in everything and everywhere yet only god can gather them together by crowning them as one with the final gift of eternity"
