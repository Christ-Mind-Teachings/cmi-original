    "text": "we said before that when a situation has been dedicated wholly to truth peace is inevitable its attainment is the criterion by which the wholeness of the dedication can be safely assumed yet we also said that peace without faith will never be attained for what is wholly dedicated to truth as its only goal is brought to truth by faith this faith encompasses everyone involved for only thus the situation is perceived as meaningful and as a whole and everyone must be involved in it or else your faith is limited and your dedication incomplete"
