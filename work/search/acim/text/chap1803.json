    "text": "you who have spent your lives in bringing truth to illusion reality to fantasy have walked the way of dreams for you have gone from waking to sleeping and on and on to a yet deeper sleep each dream has led to other dreams and every fantasy which seemed to bring a light into the darkness but made the darkness deeper your goal was darkness in which no ray of light could enter and you sought a blackness so complete that you could hide from truth forever in complete insanity what you forgot was simply that god cannot destroy himself the light is in you darkness can cover it but cannot put it out"
