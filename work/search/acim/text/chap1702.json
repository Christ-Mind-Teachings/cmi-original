    "text": "all this beauty will rise to bless your sight as you look upon the world with forgiving eyes for forgiveness literally transforms vision and lets you see the real world reaching quietly and gently across chaos and removing all illusions which had twisted your perception and fixed it on the past the smallest leaf becomes a thing of wonder and a blade of grass a sign of gods perfection from the forgiven world the son of god is lifted easily into his home and there he knows that he has always rested there in peace even salvation will become a dream and vanish from his mind for salvation is the end of dreams and with the closing of the dream will have no meaning who awake in heaven could dream that there could ever be need of salvation"
