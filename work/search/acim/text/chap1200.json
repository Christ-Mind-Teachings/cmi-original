    "text": "the ultimate purpose of projection as the ego uses it is always to get rid of guilt yet characteristically the ego attempts to get rid of guilt from its viewpoint only for much as the ego wants to retain guilt you find it intolerable since guilt stands in the way of your remembering godwhose pull is so strong that you cannot resist it on this issue then the deepest split of all occurs for if you are to retain guilt as the ego insists you cannot be you only by persuading you that it is you could the ego possibly induce you to project guilt and thereby keep it in your mind"
