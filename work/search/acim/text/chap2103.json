    "text": "all special relationships have sin as their goal for they are bargains with reality toward which the seeming union is adjusted forget not this to bargain is to set a limit and any brother with whom you have a limited relationship you hate you may attempt to keep the bargain in the name of fairness sometimes demanding payment of yourself perhaps more often of the other thus in the fairness you attempt to ease the guilt that comes from the accepted purpose of the relationship and that is why the holy spirit must change its purpose to make it useful to him and harmless unto you"
