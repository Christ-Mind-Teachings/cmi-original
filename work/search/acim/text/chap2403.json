    "text": "forgiveness is the end of specialness only illusions can be forgiven and then they disappear forgiveness is release from all illusions and that is why it is impossible but partly to forgive no one who clings to one illusion can see himself as sinless for he holds one error to himself as lovely still and so he calls it unforgiveable and makes it sin how can he then give his forgiveness wholly when he would not receive it for himself for it is sure he would receive it wholly the instant that he gave it so and thus his secret guilt would disappear forgiven by himself"
