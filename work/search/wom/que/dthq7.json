    "text": "that is a very the tunnel experience being spoken of in your cultures as the near death experience is a very very basic first stage of the dying process primarily it entails the withdrawal of energy from the brain core from the brain core to the stem of the body or toward the spine of the body it creates the perception of the tunnel in which there is a withdrawal from the senses of the body into this what appears to be a tunnel and it is a portal and a doorway and yes i appear to many and others appear as well but the belief system is still functioning that is only one of the first stages of the actual death process"

    "text": "as it continues and as the brain core literally dies which simply means that life force is withdrawn and not returned to it so it is dropped like old baggage then the soul the consciousness experiences a vibrational leap what you might call a quantum leap in vibrational states into more and more subtle states of its own being but there is a period in which there is a playing out of the residual effects of all of its perceptions and beliefs it is called the in one stage the life story is played back that fast snaps fingers thoughts or fears of a satan or beliefs in a savior become the energy which attracts that experience to that individual"

    "text": "so in a general sense there is something that occurs energetically but what occurs within that energy is entirely unique to each individual and what will matter is this if time has been used constructively that is if you utilized time to let go of limiting beliefs and begin to foster first faith and then direct experience in tapping into other dimensions into remembering the mind of god if you practiced forgiveness and healing then at death fear has no place to grip the mind"

    "text": "yes the tunnel begins to happen because the energy is being withdrawn from the cellular structure of the body from the brain itself toward the brain stem what i call the stem or the interior of the spine and since the mind has been cultivating devotion to god the willingness to heal the ability to let go without fear then as these things come up and move through very very quickly they have no effect whatsoever and the mind proceeds toward light greater and greater dimensions of light hm and it is possible for the soul then to remain in those dimensions without any need of incarnating again it is always something left unhealed a fear a self judgment a resentment an old anger that creates a heaviness that draws the soul using its infinite power to re create third dimensional physicality yet again to try to get it right it is always much wiser to use the incarnation you have to get it right dont think about the old ones dont think about the ones that might come realize that right where you are right where you are everything is perfect for your awakening"
