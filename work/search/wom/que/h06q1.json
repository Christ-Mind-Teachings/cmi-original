    "text": "a course in miracles was given initially to two people who had asked from the depth of their being although they were not aware of it at the time to be shown a way to perceive differently a wise teacher first learns the language of the student and the two that asked the question carried an orientation in which their primary mechanism for experience was through the level of the mind or the intellect therefore the teaching tool needed to be conveyed in a way that could be acceptable to them as the student"
