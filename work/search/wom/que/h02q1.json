    "text": "but secondly this also affects the nature of the mind itself the thinking mind that is linked to the body and to the vibrational field of physicality through the process of fasting the mind also slows down it becomes more open spaciousness is created within it and why is that valuable because the soul wants to begin sending new signals down through the levels or depths of mind through the thinking mind down into the cells of the body its seeking to recreate its perceptions its structure that your lower self your egoic mind the mind that carries you through the day has been operating from its seeking to change this so fasting is not just a matter of the body alone it affects the thinking mechanism of the brain as well allowing new electrical signals to pulse through the brain and down through the body and likewise it creates a spaciousness so that new frequencies can be received"
