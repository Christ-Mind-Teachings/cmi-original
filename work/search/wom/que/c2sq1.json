    "text": "now in time there was in fact what is called a resurrection there have been many many stories about this its not quite as fanciful as some would make it out to be it means simply that because my consciousness through this final lesson to myself had become thoroughly settled or centered in the recognition only of the real world there came a point when the body or the dust of the ground merely lying there upon what you would call a sheet upon a small platform within a certain cavern or cave given unto me by the way by my uncle joseph of arimathea i just wanted to get that in for you now there was a time then when there was simply no need for even that dead physical form to abide it began to dissolve quicken its what do you call this decomposition if you will and literally returned to what you would call a molecular or atomic state a place of almost pure energy and certainly not to be seen by the physical eyes but trust me it was still there specks of dust you might call it but much much smaller"
