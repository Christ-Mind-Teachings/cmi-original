    "text": "beloved friend unanswered questions are always a form of doubt unanswered questions reflect the quality of mind birthed not in god but in the world the attempt to hope that someone else will create the energies necessary in the third dimension to allow you not necessarily â€˜you but the general you to get what it thinks it needs closer proximity to other bodies in space yet being in denial of stepping into the role of what you might call leadership to bring that about therefore understand well there are many that are being called and some seem to have answered that call a little sooner than others"

    "text": "for if you would view that which is a communion or a coming together of souls in the third dimension and some are relying on others to carry the frequency you have inequality you have conflict you have dissonance dissonance weakens the field of energy and the note that would come through the instrument does not carry the power you would wish to behold that then creates resentment in the minds of those who are wanting others to really take responsibility and resentment simply creates in fighting and death therefore mark these words well shanti christo is the responsibility of everyone who genuinely feels called to its manifestation pure and simple for it is a grand experiment to bring forth the unified field which is the christ mind"
