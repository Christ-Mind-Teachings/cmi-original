          "question": "Jeshua states that He has never enlightened anyone. Yet the
            Sufi and Hindu traditions, including a number of gurus, state that they
            do most of the work for one person. They say that once someone
            surrenders to them, through their own God Consciousness, they can bring
            that being to Oneness. There are also traditions which state that one
            must look into the eyes of a true guru to become enlightened. Let’s face
            it, it does sound quicker and easier. Is this a different state of
            awareness? Was this tradition meant for a different era?"
