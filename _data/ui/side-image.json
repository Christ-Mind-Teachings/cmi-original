        It is Paul’s hope that this volume might encourage you and others to
        reach out, to become aware of the loving guidance which is ever presently
        available to you. It is further his hope that through your discovery of
        your relationship one has with one’s Guide, together with the absolute
        lack of need for any defensiveness—the fact that this relationship is
        experienced from one’s own Center—will begin to reveal that this is where
        all relationships occur in their Reality, rather than through
        three-dimensional space from body to body.

        This book will perhaps be the most difficult book you have ever read
        because it squarely calls the ego into question and gives you direction
        and encouragement regarding the only way to release it.  It is not
        designed to be difficult.  In fact, you will find the reading easy,
        palatable.  The words will not be difficult to understand, but the
        movement they will create in you will.

        This book will require you to
        move beyond understanding and dare to live from there!  It brings the
        principles of A Course In Miracles into bold relief, whether you are a
        Course student or not.  It brings the principles of Christian Science
        into bold relief, whether you are a student or not.  It brings the
        principles of Life into bold relief, whether you are avoiding It or
        not.  It addresses you in terms of your divinity and says, wake up!
        And it addresses you in the language of your humanity so that you might
        comprehend it.<br/><cite>Rajpur ~ from the Foreward</cite>

          <em>The Way of the Heart</em> is that pathway that begins with a commitment to
          healing and awakening, and is founded on the premise that you are
