## Blackbird - The Beatles White Album
{: .omit}

Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br/>
Take these broken wings and learn to fly<br/>
All your life<br/>
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br/>
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see<br/>
All your life<br/>
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly<br/>
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly<br/>
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night<br/>
Take these broken wings and learn to fly<br/>
All your life<br/>
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

You were only waiting for this moment to arise

You were only waiting for this moment to arise

## Imagine - John Lennon
{: .omit}

Imagine there's no heaven<br/>
It's easy if you try<br/>
No hell below us<br/>
Above us, only sky<br/>
Imagine all the people living for today<br/>
Imagine there's no countries<br/>
It isn't hard to do<br/>
Nothing to kill or die for<br/>
And no religion, too<br/>
Imagine all the people living life in peace<br/>
You...

You may say I'm a dreamer<br/>
But I'm not the only one<br/>
I hope some day you'll join us<br/>
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions<br/>
I wonder if you can<br/>
No need for greed or hunger<br/>
A brotherhood of man<br/>
Imagine all the people sharing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer<br/>
But I'm not the only one<br/>
I hope some day you'll join us<br/>
And the world will live as one

## Over the Rainbow - Israel Kamakawiwo'ole
{: .omit}

Somewhere over the rainbow<br/>
Way up high<br/>
And the dreams that you dreamed of<br/>
Once in a lullaby<br/>
Somewhere over the rainbow<br/>
Blue birds fly<br/>
And the dreams that you dreamed of<br/>
Dreams really do come true ooh ooooh<br/>
Someday I'll wish upon a star<br/>
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me<br/>
Where trouble melts like lemon drops<br/>
High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me<br/>
Oh somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly<br/>
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

Well I see trees of green and red roses too<br/>
I'll watch them bloom for me and you<br/>
And I think to myself<br/>
What a wonderful world

Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white<br/>
And the brightness of day highlight the dark and I think to myself<br/>
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky<br/>
Are also on the faces of people passing by<br/>
I see friends shaking hands<br/>
Saying, "How do you do?"<br/>
They're really saying, "I...I love you"<br/>
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow<br/>
They'll learn much more<br/>
Than we'll know<br/>
And I think to myself<br/>
What a wonderful world, world

Someday I'll wish upon a star<br/>
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me<br/>
Where trouble melts like lemon drops<br/>
High above the chimney top that's where you'll find me<br/>
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow, way up high<br/>
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I? I?
