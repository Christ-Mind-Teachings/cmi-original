If you want to support the library by collecting audio timing
information please fill out and submit this form. This will help
coordinate everyone helping and prevent the possibility of overlap.

Once you've submitted the form, please go to the [contact
form](/about/#send-me-a-message)
on the About page and send me a message to *reserve* pages you will work
on. Once reserved no one else will be able to collect timing data for
that page.

Don't worry, you're not obligated to complete the pages you have
reserved. Just tell me if you can't complete them all and someone else will
be assigned.

I will make the necessary changes and send you an email when you can
start. I will let you know as soon as possible.

*Thank You!*
