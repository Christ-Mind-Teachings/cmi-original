*“I did not understand what made me free, nor what my freedom is, nor
where to look to find it. Father, I have searched in vain until I heard
Your Voice directing me. Now I would guide myself no more. For I have
neither made nor understood the way to find my freedom. But I trust in
You. You Who endowed me with my freedom as Your holy Son will not be lost
to me. Your Voice directs me. And the way to You is opening and clear to
me at last. Father, my freedom is in You alone. Father, it is my will
that I return.”*

Today we answer for the world, which will be freed along with us. How
glad are we to find our freedom through the certain way our Father has
established. And how sure is all the world’s salvation, when we learn
our freedom can be found in God alone.
