Today let us review these ideas:

[*31*](/acim/workbook/l031/?r=1) **“I am not the victim of the world I see.”**
{: #l031}

How can I be the victim of a world that can be completely undone if I so
choose? My chains are loosened. I can drop them off merely by desiring
to do so. The prison door is open. I can leave it simply by walking out.
Nothing holds me in this world. Only my wish to stay keeps me a
prisoner. I would give up insane wishes, and walk into the sunlight at
last.

[*32*](/acim/workbook/l032/?r=1) **“I have invented the world I see.”**
{: #l032}

I made up the prison in which I see myself. All I need do is recognize
this, and I am free. I have deluded myself into believing it is possible
to imprison the Son of God. I was bitterly mistaken in this belief,
which I no longer want.The Son of God must be forever free. He is as God
created him, and not what I would make of him. He is where God would
have him be, and not where I thought to hold him prisoner.

[*33*](/acim/workbook/l033/?r=1) **“There is another way of looking at the world.”**
{: #l033}

Since the purpose of the world is not the one I ascribed to it, there
must be another way of looking at it. I see everything upside down, and
my thoughts are the opposite of truth. I see the world as a prison for
God’s Son. It must be, then, that the world is really a place where he
can be set free. I would look upon the world as it is, and see it as a
place where the Son of God finds his freedom.

[*34*](/acim/workbook/l034/?r=1) **“I could see peace instead of this.”**
{: #l034}

When I see the world as a place of freedom, I will realize that it
reflects the laws of God instead of the rules which I made up for it to
obey. I will understand that peace, not war, abides in it. And I will
perceive that peace also abides in the hearts of all who share this
place with me.

[*35*](/acim/workbook/l035/?r=1) **“My mind is part of God’s. I am very holy.”**
{: #l035}

As I share the peace of the world with my brothers, I begin to
understand that this peace comes from deep within myself.The world I
look upon has taken on the light of my forgiveness, and shines
forgiveness back at me. In this light, I begin to see what my illusions
about myself had kept hidden. I begin to understand the holiness of all
living things including myself, and their oneness with me.
