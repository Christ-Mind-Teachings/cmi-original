*“Who is my brother but Your holy Son? And if I see him sinful, I
proclaim myself a sinner; not a Son of God; alone and friendless in a
fearful world. Yet this perception is a choice I make, and can
relinquish. I can also see my brother sinless, as Your holy Son. And with
this choice I see my sinlessness, my everlasting Comforter and Friend
beside me, and my way secure and clear. Choose, then, for me, my Father,
through Your Voice. For He alone gives judgement in Your Name.”*
