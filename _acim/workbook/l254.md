*“Father, today I would but hearYour Voice. In deepest silence I would
come to You, to hear Your Voice and to receive Your Word. I have no
prayer but this: I come to You to ask You for the truth. And truth is
but Your Will, which I would share with You today.”*

Today we let no evil thoughts direct our words or actions. When such
thoughts occur, we quietly step back and look at them, and then we let
them go. We do not want what they would bring with them. And so we do
not choose to keep them. They are silent now. And in the stillness,
hallowed by His Love, God speaks to us and tells us of our Will, as we
have chosen to remember Him.
