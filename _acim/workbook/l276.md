What is the Word of God? “My Son is pure, and holy as Myself.” And thus
did God become the Father of the Son He loves, for thus was he created.
This the Word His Son did not create with Him, because in this His Son
was born. Let us accept His Fatherhood, and all is given us. Deny we
were created in His Love and we deny our Self, to be unsure of who we
are, of who our Father is, and for what purpose we have come. And yet,
we need but to acknowledge Him Who gave His Word to us in our creation,
to remember Him and so recall our Self.

*“Father,Your Word is mine. And it is this that I would speak to all my
brothers, who are given me to cherish as my own, as I am loved and
blessed and saved by You.”*
