These are our review ideas for today:

[*77*](/acim/workbook/l077/?r=1) **“I am entitled to miracles.”**
{: #l077}

I am entitled to miracles because I am under no laws but God’s. His laws
release me from all grievances, and replace them with miracles. And I
would accept the miracles in place of the grievances, which are but
illusions that hide the miracles beyond. Now I would accept only what
the laws of God entitle me to have, that I may use it on behalf of the
function He has given me.

You might use these suggestions for specific applications of this idea:

> “Behind this is a miracle to which I am entitled.”<br/>
> “Let me not hold a grievance against you (name), but offer you the miracle that belongs to you instead.”<br/>
> “Seen truly, this offers me a miracle.”

[*78*](/acim/workbook/l078/?r=1) **“Let miracles replace all grievances.”**
{: #l078}

By this idea do I unite my will with the Holy Spirit’s, and perceive
them as one. By this idea do I accept my release from hell. By this idea
do I express my willingness to have all my illusions be replaced with
truth, according to God’s plan for my salvation. I would make no
exceptions and no substitutes. I want all of Heaven and only Heaven, as
God wills me to have.

Useful specific forms for applying this idea would be:

> “I would not hold this grievance apart from my salvation.”<br/>
> “Let our grievances be replaced by miracles, (name).”<br/>
> “Beyond this is the miracle by which all my grievances are replaced.”
