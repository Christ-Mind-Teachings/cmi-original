Today we will review these ideas:

[*75*](/acim/workbook/l075/?r=1) **“The light has come.”**
{: #l075}

In choosing salvation rather than attack, I merely choose to recognize
what is already here. Salvation is a decision made already. Attack and
grievances are not there to choose. That is why I always choose between
truth and illusion; between what is there and what is not. The light has
come. I can but choose the light, for it has no alternative. It has
replaced the darkness, and the dark has gone.

These would prove useful forms for specific applications of this idea:

> “This cannot show me darkness, for the light has come.”<br/>
> “The light in you is all that I would see, (name).”<br/>
> “I would see in this only what is there.”

[*76*](/acim/workbook/l076/?r=1) **“I am under no laws but God’s.”**
{: #l076}

Here is the perfect statement of my freedom. I am under no laws but
God’s. I am constantly tempted to make up other laws and give them power
over me. I suffer only because of my belief in them. They have no real
effect on me at all. I am perfectly free of the effects of all laws save
God’s. And His are the laws of freedom.

For specific forms in applying this idea, these would be useful:

> “My perception of this shows me I believe in laws which do not exist.”<br/>
> “I see only the laws of God at work in this.”<br/>
> “Let me allow God’s laws to work in this, and not my own.”
