For morning and evening review:

[*93*](/acim/workbook/l093/?r=1) **“Light and joy and peace abide in me.”**
{: #l093}

> I am the home of light and joy and peace.<br/>
> I welcome them into the home I share<br/>
> With God, because I am a part of Him.

[*94*](/acim/workbook/l094/?r=1) **“I am as God created me.”**
{: #l094}

> I will remain forever as I was,<br/>
> Created by the Changeless like Himself.<br/>
> And I am one with Him, and He with me.

On the hour:

> “Light and joy and peace abide in me.”

On the half hour:

> “I am as God created me.”
