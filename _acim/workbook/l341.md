title: "I can attack but my own sinlessness,<br/>And it is only that which keeps me safe."
ref: "Part II: Lesson 341"

*“Father,Your Son is holy. I am he on whom You smile in love and
tenderness so deep and dear and still the universe smiles back on You,
and shares Your holiness. How pure, how safe, how sacred, then, are we,
abiding in Your Smile, with all Your love bestowed upon us, living one
with You, in brotherhood and Fatherhood complete; in sinlessness so
perfect that the Lord of Sinlessness conceives us as His Son, a universe
of Thought completing Him.”*

Let us not, then, attack our sinlessness. For it contains the Word of
God to us, and in its kind reflection we are saved.
