*“Father, today I would let all things be as You created them, and give
Your Sons the honor due their sinlessness; the love of brother to his
brother and his friend. Through this I am redeemed. Through this as well
the truth will enter where illusions were, light will replace all
darkness, and Your Son will know he is as You created him.”*

A special blessing comes to us today from Him Who is our Father. Give
this day to Him and there will be no fear today, because the day is
given unto Love.
