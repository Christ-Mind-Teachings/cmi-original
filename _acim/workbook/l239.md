Let not the truth about ourselves today be hidden by a false humility.
Let us instead be thankful for the gifts our Father gave us. Can we see
in those with whom He shares His glory any trace of sin and guilt? And
can it be that we are not among them, when He loves His Son forever and
with perfect constancy, knowing he is as He created him?

*“We thank You, Father, for the light that shines forever in us. And we
honor it, because You share it with us. We are one, united in this light
and one with You, at peace with all creation and ourselves.”*
