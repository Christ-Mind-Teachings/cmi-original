*“Why should I wait, my Father, for the joy You promised me? For You
will keep Your Word You gave Your Son in exile. I am sure my treasure
waits for me, and I need but reach out my hand to find it. Even now my
fingers touch it. It is very close. I need not wait an instant more, to
be at peace forever. It is You I choose, and my Identity along with You.
Your Son would be Himself, and know You as his Father and Creator and
his Love.”*
