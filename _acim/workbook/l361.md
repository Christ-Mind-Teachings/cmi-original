*“If I need a word to help me He will give it to me. If I need a
thought, that will He also give. And if I need but stillness and a
tranquil, open mind, these are the gifts I will receive of Him. He is in
charge by my request. And He will hear and answer me, because He speaks
for God my Father and His holy Son.”*
