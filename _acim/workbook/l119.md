For morning and evening review:

[*107*](/acim/workbook/l107/?r=1) **“Truth will correct all errors in my mind.”**
{: #l107}

> I am mistaken when I think I can<br/>
> Be hurt in any way. I am God’s Son,<br/>
> Whose Self rests safely in the Mind of God.

[*108*](/acim/workbook/l108/?r=1) **“To give and to receive are one in truth.”**
{: #l108}

> I will forgive all things today, that I<br/>
> May learn how to accept the truth in me,<br/>
> And come to recognize my sinlessness.

On the hour:

> “Truth will correct all errors in my mind.”

On the half hour:

> “To give and to receive are one in truth.”
