title: "I will not be afraid of love today."
ref: "Part II: Lesson 282"

If I could realize but this today, salvation would be reached for all
the world. This the decision not to be insane, and to accept myself as
God Himself, my Father and my Source, created me. This the determination
not to be asleep in dreams of death, while truth remains forever living
in the joy of life. And this the choice to recognize the Self Whom God
created as the Son He loves, and Who remains my one Reality.

*“Father,Your Name is Love, and so is mine. Such is the truth. And can
the truth be changed by merely giving it another name? The name of fear
is simply a mistake. Let me not be afraid of truth today.”*
