Today’s review covers these ideas:

[*6*](/acim/workbook/l006/?r=1) **“I am upset because I see what is not there.”**
{: #l006}

Reality is never frightening. It is impossible that it could upset me.
Reality brings only perfect peace. When I am upset, it is always because
I have replaced reality with illusions which I made up. The illusions
are upsetting because I have given them reality, and thus regard reality
as an illusion. Nothing in God’s creation is affected in any way by this
confusion of mine. I am always upset by nothing.

[*7*](/acim/workbook/l007/?r=1) **“I see only the past.”**
{: #l007}

As I look about, I condemn the world I look upon. I call this seeing. I
hold the past against everyone and everything, making them my
“enemies.”When I have forgiven myself and remembered who I am, I will
bless everyone and everything I see. There will be no past, and
therefore no “enemies.” And I will look with God on all that I failed to
see before.

[*8*](/acim/workbook/l008/?r=1) **“My mind is preoccupied with past thoughts.”**
{: #l008}

I see only my own thoughts, and my mind is preoccupied with the past.
What, then, can I see as it is? Let me remember that I look on the past
to prevent the present from dawning on my mind. Let me understand that I
am trying to use time against God. Let me learn to give the past away,
realizing that in so doing I am giving up nothing.

[*9*](/acim/workbook/l009/?r=1) **“I see nothing as it is now.”**
{: #l009}

If I see nothing as it is now, it can truly be said that I see nothing.
I can see only what is now. The choice is not whether to see the past or
the present: it is merely whether to see or not. What I have chosen to
see has cost me vision. Now I would choose again, that I may see.

[*10*](/acim/workbook/l010/?r=1) **“My thoughts do not mean anything.”**
{: #l010}

I have no private thoughts. Yet it is only private thoughts of which I am
aware. What can these thoughts mean? They do not exist, and so they mean
nothing. Yet my mind is part of creation and part of its Creator. Would I
not rather join the thinking of the universe than to obscure all that is
really mine with my pitiful and meaningless “private” thoughts?
