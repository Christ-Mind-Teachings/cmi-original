I will be honest with myself today. I will not think that I already know
what must remain beyond my present grasp. I will not think I understand
the whole from bits of my perception, which are all that I can see.
Today I recognize that this is so. And so I am relieved of judgement
which I cannot make. Thus do I free myself and what I look upon, to be
in peace as God created us.

*“Father, today I leave creation free to be itself. I honor all the
parts, in which I am included. We are one because each part contains Your
memory, and truth must shine in all of us as one.”*
