*“Father,Your Son is perfect. When he thinks that he is hurt in any way,
it is because he has forgotten who he is. And that he is as You created
him. Your Thoughts can only bring me happiness. If ever I am sad or hurt
or ill, I have forgotten what You think, and put my little, meaningless
ideas in place of where Your Thoughts belong, and where They are. I can
be hurt by nothing but my thoughts. The Thoughts I think with You can
only bless. The Thoughts I think with You alone are true.”*

I will not hurt myself today. For I am far beyond all pain. My Father
placed me safe in Heaven, watching over me. And I would not attack the
Son He loves, for what He loves is mine to love as well.
