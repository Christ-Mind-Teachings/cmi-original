My gratitude permits my love to be accepted without fear. And thus am I
restored to my Reality at last. All that intruded on my holy sight
forgiveness takes away. And I draw near the end of senseless journeys,
mad careers, and artificial values. I accept instead what God
establishes as mine, sure that in that alone I will be saved; sure that
I go through fear to meet my Love.

*“Father, I come to You today, because I would not follow any way but
Yours. You are beside me. Certain is Your way. And I am grateful for Your
holy gifts of certain sanctuary, and escape from everything that would
obscure my love for God my Father and His holy Son.”*
