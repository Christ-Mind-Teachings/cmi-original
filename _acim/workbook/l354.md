*“My oneness with the Christ establishes me as Your Son, beyond the
reach of time, and wholly free of every law but Yours. I have no self
except the Christ in me. I have no purpose but His own. And He is like
His Father. Thus must I be one with You as well as Him. For who is
Christ except Your Son as You created Him? And what am I except the
Christ in me?”*
