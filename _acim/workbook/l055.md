Today’s review includes the following:

[*21*](/acim/workbook/l021/?r=1) **“I am determined to see things differently.”**
{: #l021}

What I see now are but signs of disease, disaster and death. This cannot
be what God created for His beloved Son. The very fact that I see such
things is proof that I do not understand God. Therefore I also do not
understand His Son. What I see tells me that I do not know who I am. I
am determined to see the witnesses to the truth in me, rather than those
which show me an illusion of myself.

[*22*](/acim/workbook/l022/?r=1) **“What I see is a form of vengeance.”**
{: #l022}

The world I see is hardly the representation of loving thoughts. It is a
picture of attack on everything and by everything. It is anything but a
reflection of the Love of God and the love of His Son. It is my own
attack thoughts which give rise to this picture. My loving thoughts will
save me from this perception of the world, and give me the peace God
intended me to have.

[*23*](/acim/workbook/l023/?r=1) **“I can escape from the world by giving up attack thoughts.”**
{: #l023}

Herein lies my salvation, and nowhere else. Without attack thoughts I
could not see a world of attack. As forgiveness allows love to return to
my awareness, I will see a world of peace and safety and joy. And it is
this that I choose to see, in place of what I look on now.

[*24*](/acim/workbook/l024/?r=1) **“I do not perceive my own best interests.”**
{: #l024}

How could I recognize my own best interests when I do not know who I am?
What I think are my best interests would merely bind me closer to the
world of illusions. I am willing to follow the Guide God has given me to
find out what my own best interests are, recognizing that I cannot
perceive them by myself.

[*25*](/acim/workbook/l025/?r=1) **“I do not know what anything is for.”**
{: #l025}

To me, the purpose of everything is to prove that my illusions about
myself are real. It is for that purpose that I attempt to use everyone
and everything. It is this that I believe the world is for. Therefore I
do not recognize its real purpose.The purpose I have given the world has
led to a frightening picture of it. Let me open my mind to its real
purpose by withdrawing the one I have given it, and learning the truth
about it.
