Today’s review will cover these ideas:

[*69*](/acim/workbook/l069/?r=1) **“My grievances hide the light of the world in me.”**
{: #l069}

My grievances show me what is not there, and hide from me what I would
see. Recognizing this, what do I want my grievances for? They keep me in
darkness and hide the light. Grievances and light cannot go together,
but light and vision must be joined for me to see. To see, I must lay
grievances aside. I want to see, and this will be the means by which I
will succeed.

Specific applications of this idea might be made in these forms:

> “Let me not use this as a block to sight.”<br/>
> “The light of the world will shine all this away.”<br/>
> “I have no need for this. I want to see.”

[*70*](/acim/workbook/l070/?r=1) **“My salvation comes from me.”**
{: #l070}

Today I will recognize where my salvation is. It is in me because its
Source is there. It has not left its Source and so it cannot have left
my mind. I will not look for it outside myself. It is not found outside
and then brought in. But from within me it will reach beyond, and
everything I see will but reflect the light that shines in me and in
itself.

These forms of the idea are suitable for more specific application:

> “Let this not tempt me to look away from me for my salvation.”<br/>
> “I will not let this interfere with my awareness of the Source of my salvation.”<br/>
> “This has no power to remove salvation from me.”
