These ideas are for review today:

[*36*](/acim/workbook/l036/?r=1) **“My holiness envelops everything I see.”**
{: #l036}

From my holiness does the perception of the real world come. Having
forgiven, I no longer see myself as guilty. I can accept the innocence
that is the truth about me. Seen through understanding eyes the holiness
of the world is all I see, for I can picture only the thoughts I hold
about myself.

[*37*](/acim/workbook/l037/?r=1) **“My holiness blesses the world.”**
{: #l037}

The perception of my holiness does not bless me alone. Everyone and
everything I see in its light shares in the joy it brings to me. There
is nothing that is apart from this joy, because there is nothing that
does not share my holiness. As I recognize my holiness, so does the
holiness of the world shine forth for everyone to see.

[*38*](/acim/workbook/l038/?r=1) **“There is nothing my holiness cannot do.”**
{: #l038}

My holiness is unlimited in its power to heal, because it is unlimited
in its power to save. What is there to be saved from except illusions?
And what are all illusions except false ideas about myself? My holiness
undoes them all by asserting the truth about me. In the presence of my
holiness, which I share with God Himself, all idols vanish.

[*39*](/acim/workbook/l039/?r=1) **“My holiness is my salvation.”**
{: #l039}

Since my holiness saves me from all guilt, recognizing my holiness is
recognizing my salvation. It is also recognizing the salvation of the
world. Once I have accepted my holiness, nothing can make me afraid. And
because I am unafraid, everyone must share in my understanding, which is
the gift of God to me and to the world.

[*40*](/acim/workbook/l040/?r=1) **“I am blessed as a Son of God.”**
{: #l040}

Herein lies my claim to all good and only good. I am blessed as a Son of
God. All good things are mine because God intended them for me. I cannot
suffer any loss or deprivation or pain because of who I am. My Father
supports me, protects me, and directs me in all things. His care for me
is infinite, and is with me forever. I am eternally blessed as His Son.
