[*91*](/acim/workbook/l091/?r=1) **“Miracles are seen in light.”**
{: #l091}

> I cannot see in darkness. Let the light<br/>
> Of holiness and truth light up my mind,<br/>
> And let me see the innocence within.

[*92*](/acim/workbook/l092/?r=1) **“Miracles are seen in light, and light and strength are one.”**

> My weakness is the dark His gift dispels<br/>
> By giving me His strength to take its place.

On the hour:
