*“Father, I give all that is mine today to Christ, to use in any way
that best will serve the purpose that I share with Him. Nothing is mine
alone, for He and I have joined in purpose. Thus has learning come
almost to its appointed end. A while I work with Him to serve His
purpose. Then I lose myself in my Identity, and recognize that Christ is
but my Self.”*
