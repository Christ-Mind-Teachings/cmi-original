The following ideas are for review today:

[*41*](/acim/workbook/l041/?r=1) **“God goes with me wherever I go.”**
{: #l041}

How can I be alone when God always goes with me? How can I be doubtful
and unsure of myself when perfect certainty abides in Him? How can I be
disturbed by anything when He rests in me in absolute peace? How can I
suffer when love and joy surround me through Him? Let me not cherish
illusions about myself. I am perfect because God goes with me wherever I
go.

[*42*](/acim/workbook/l042/?r=1) **“God is my strength. Vision is His gift.”**
{: #l042}

Let me not look to my own eyes to see today. Let me be willing to
exchange my pitiful illusion of seeing for the vision that is given by
God. Christ’s vision is His gift, and He has given it to me. Let me call
upon this gift today, so that this day may help me to understand
eternity.

[*43*](/acim/workbook/l043/?r=1) **“God is my Source. I cannot see apart from Him.”**
{: #l043}

I can see what God wants me to see. I cannot see anything else. Beyond
His Will lie only illusions. It is these I choose when I think I can see
apart from Him. It is these I choose when I try to see through the
body’s eyes.Yet the vision of Christ has been given me to replace them.
It is through this vision that I choose to see.

[*44*](/acim/workbook/l044/?r=1) **“God is the light in which I see.”**
{: #l044}

I cannot see in darkness. God is the only Light. Therefore if I am to
see, it must be through Him. I have tried to define what seeing is, and
I have been wrong. Now it is given me to understand that God is the
Light in which I see. Let me welcome vision and the happy world it will
show me.

[*45*](/acim/workbook/l045/?r=1) **“God is the Mind with which I think.”**
{: #l045}

I have no thoughts I do not share with God. I have no thoughts apart
from Him because I have no mind apart from His. As part of His Mind, my
thoughts are His and His Thoughts are mine.
