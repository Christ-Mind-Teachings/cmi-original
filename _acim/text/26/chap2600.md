In the “dynamics” of attack is sacrifice a key idea. It is the
pivot upon which ALL compromise, ALL desperate attempts to strike a
bargain, and ALL conflicts achieve a seeming balance. It is the symbol
of the central theme that SOMEBODY MUST LOSE. Its focus on the body is
apparent, for it is always an attempt to LIMIT LOSS. The body is itself
a sacrifice; a giving up of power in the name of saving just a little
for yourself. To see a brother in another body, separate from yours, is
the expression of a wish to see a little part of him and sacrifice the
rest. Look at the world, and you will see nothing attached to anything
beyond itself. All seeming entities can come a little nearer, or go a
little farther off, but CANNOT join.
