To heal is to liberate totally. We once said there is no order of
difficulty in miracles because they are ALL maximal expressions of love.
This has no range at all. The non-maximal only APPEARS to have a range.
This is because it SEEMS to be meaningful to measure it FROM the
maximum, and identify its position by HOW MUCH it is NOT there.
Actually, this does not mean anything. It is like negative numbers in
that the concept can be used theoretically, but it has no application
practically. It is true that if you put three apples on the table and
then take them away, the three apples are not there. But it is NOT true
that the table is now minus three apples. If there is NOTHING on the
table, it does not matter what WAS there in terms of amount. The
“nothing” is neither greater nor less because of what is absent.

That is why “all” and “nothing” are dichotomous, WITHOUT a range. This
is perfectly clear in considering psychological tests of maximal
performance. You cannot interpret the results AT ALL unless you assume
either MAXIMAL motivation or NO motivation at all. Only in these two
conditions can you validly compare responses, and you MUST assume the
former because, if the latter were true, the subject would not do
ANYTHING. Given VARIABLE motivation he WILL do something, but YOU cannot
understand WHAT IT IS.

The results of such tests are evaluated relatively ASSUMING maximal
motivation, but this is because we are dealing with ABILITIES, where
degree of development is meaningful. This does NOT mean that what the
ability is used FOR is necessarily either limited OR divided. Yet one
thing is certain; abilities are POTENTIALS for learning, and you will
apply them to what you WANT to learn. Learning is EFFORT, and effort
means WILL. We have used the term “abilities” in the plural because
abilities began with the ego, which perceived them as POTENTIALS FOR
EXCELLING. This is how the ego STILL perceives them and uses them.

The ego does not WANT to teach everyone all it has learned, because that
would DEFEAT its purpose. Therefore, it does not REALLY learn at all. The
Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made to teach the
OPPOSITE of what the ego has learned. The KIND of learning is as
irrelevant as is the particular ability which was applied TO the
learning. You could not have a better example of the Holy Spirit’s
unified purpose than this course. The Holy Spirit has taken very
diversified areas of YOUR learning, and has applied them to a UNIFIED
curriculum. The fact that this was NOT the ego’s reason for learning is
totally irrelevant.

YOU made the effort to learn, and the Holy Spirit has a unified goal for
ALL effort. HE ADAPTS the ego’s potentials for excelling to potentials
for EQUALIZING. This makes them USELESS for the ego’s purpose, but VERY
useful for His. If different abilities are applied long enough to one
goal, the abilities THEMSELVES become unified. This is because they are
channelized in one direction, or in one WAY. Ultimately, then, they all
contribute to ONE RESULT, and by so doing, their similarity rather than
their differences is emphasized. You can EXCEL in many DIFFERENT ways,
but you can EQUALIZE in ONE WAY ONLY. Equality is NOT a variable state,
by definition.

That is why you will be able to perform ALL aspects of your work with
ease when you have learned THIS course. To the ego there appears to be
no connection because the EGO is discontinuous. Yet the Holy Spirit
teaches ONE lesson, and applies it to ALL individuals in ALL situations.
Being conflict-free, He maximizes ALL efforts and ALL results. By
teaching the power of the
Kingdom of God Himself, He teaches you that ALL POWER IS YOURS. Its
application does not matter. It is ALWAYS maximal. Your vigilance does
not ESTABLISH it as yours, but it DOES enable you to use it ALWAYS and
in ALL WAYS.

When I said,“I am with you always,” I meant it literally. I am not
absent to ANYONE, in ANY situation. BECAUSE I am always with you, YOU
are the Way and the Truth and the Light. You did not make this power any
more than I did. It was created to BE shared, and therefore cannot be
meaningfully perceived as belonging to anyone AT THE EXPENSE of another.
Such a perception makes it meaningless by eliminating or overlooking its
REAL and ONLY meaning.
