Only YOU can limit your creative power, but God wills to release it. He
no more wills you to deprive yourself of your creations than He wills to
deprive Himself of His. Do not withhold your gifts to the Sonship, or
you withhold yourself from God. Selfishness is of the ego, but
self-fullness is of the Soul because that is how God created it. The
Holy Spirit is the part of the mind that lies between the ego and the
Soul, mediating between them ALWAYS in favor of the Soul. To the ego
this is partiality, and it therefore responds as if it were the
part that is being sided AGAINST. To the Soul this is truth, because it
knows its fullness, and cannot conceive of any part from which it is
excluded.

The Soul KNOWS that the consciousness of all its brothers is included in
its own, as IT is included in God. The power of the whole Sonship AND of
its Creator is therefore the Soul’s own fullness, rendering its
creations equally whole and equal in perfection. The ego cannot prevail
against a totality which includes God, and any totality MUST include
God. Everything He created is given all His power because it is part of
Him and shares His Being with Him. Creating is the opposite of loss, as
blessing is the opposite of sacrifice. Being MUST be extended. That is
how it retains the knowledge of ITSELF.

The Soul yearns to share its being as ITS Creator did. Created BY
sharing, its will is to create. It does not wish to CONTAIN God but to
EXTEND His Being. The extension of God’s Being is the Soul’s ONLY
function. Its fullness cannot be contained, any more than can the
fullness of its Creator. Fullness IS extension. The ego’s whole thought
system blocks extension, and thus blocks your only function. It
therefore blocks your joy, and that is why you perceive yourselves as
unfulfilled. Unless you create you ARE unfulfilled, but God does not
know of unfulfillment, and therefore you MUST create. YOU may not know
your own creations, but this can no more interfere with their reality
than your unawareness of your Soul can interfere with its being.

The Kingdom is forever extending because it is in the Mind of God. You
do not KNOW your joy because you do not know your own self-fullness.
Exclude ANY part of the Kingdom from yourself, and you are NOT whole. A
split mind cannot perceive its fullness, and needs the miracle of its
wholeness to dawn upon it and heal it. This reawakens the wholeness in
it, and restores it to the Kingdom because of its ACCEPTANCE of
wholeness. The full appreciation of its self-fullness makes selfishness
impossible and extension inevitable. That is why there is perfect peace
in the Kingdom. Every Soul IS fulfilling its function, and only complete
fulfilment IS peace.

Insanity APPEARS to add to reality, but no-one would claim that what it
adds is true. Insanity is therefore the NON-extension of
truth, which blocks joy because it blocks creation, and thus blocks
self-fulfilment. The unfulfilled MUST be depressed because their
self-fullness is unknown to them. Your creations are protected FOR you
because the Holy Spirit, Who is in your mind, knows of them and can
bring them INTO your awareness whenever you will let Him. They are there
as part of your own being because your fulfilment INCLUDES them. The
creations of every Son of God are yours since every creation belongs to
everyone, being created for the Sonship as a whole.

You have NOT failed to add to the inheritance of the Sons of God, and
thus have not failed to secure it for yourselves. If it was the Will of
God to give it to you, He gave it forever. If it was His Will that you
have it forever, He gave you the means for keeping it, AND YOU HAVE DONE
SO. Disobeying God’s Will is meaningful only to the insane. In truth it
is impossible. Your self-fullness is as boundless as God’s. Like His, it
extends forever and in perfect peace. Its radiance is so intense that it
creates in perfect joy, and only the whole can be born of its wholeness.

Be confident that you have never lost your identity and the extensions
which maintain it in wholeness and peace. Miracles are an EXPRESSION of
this confidence. They are reflections both of your own proper
identification with your brothers, and of your own awareness that your
identification IS maintained by extension. The miracle is a LESSON IN
TOTAL PERCEPTION. By including ANY part of totality in the lesson, you
HAVE included the whole. You have said that, when you write of the
Kingdom and your creations which belong in it, you are describing WHAT
YOU DO NOT KNOW. That is true in a sense, but no more true than your
failure to acknowledge the whole result of the ego’s premises. The
Kingdom is the result of premises, just as this world is.

You HAVE carried the ego’s reasoning to its logical conclusion, which is
TOTAL CONFUSION ABOUT EVERYTHING. Yet you do not really BELIEVE this, or
you could not possibly maintain it. If you really saw this result, you
could not WANT it. The only reason why you could possibly want ANY part
of it is because you do NOT see the whole of it. You are willing to look
at the ego’s premises, but NOT at their logical outcome. Is it not
possible that you have done
the same thing with the premises of God?

Your creations ARE the logical outcome of His premises. His thinking has
established them FOR you. They are therefore there, EXACTLY where they
belong. They belong in your mind as part of your identification with
His, but your state of mind and your recognition of what is IN your mind
depends, at any given moment, on what you believe ABOUT your
mind. Whatever these beliefs may be, they are the premises which will
determine what you accept INTO your mind. It is surely clear that you
can both accept into your mind what is not really there, and deny what
IS. Neither of these possibilities requires further elaboration here,
but both are clearly indefensible, even if you elect to defend them.

Yet the function which God Himself gave your minds through His you may
deny, but you cannot prevent. It is the logical outcome of what you ARE.
The ability to see a logical outcome depends on the WILLINGNESS to see
it, but its truth has nothing to do with your willingness at all. Truth
is GOD’S WILL. SHARE His Will, and you share what He knows. DENY His
Will as yours, and you are denying His Kingdom AND yours. The Holy
Spirit will direct you only so as to avoid pain. The undoing of pain
must obviously avoid pain. Surely no-one would object to this goal IF HE
RECOGNIZED IT. The problem is not whether what the Holy Spirit says is
true, but whether you want to LISTEN to what He says.
