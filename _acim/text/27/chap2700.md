The wish to be unfairly treated is a compromise attempt that would
COMBINE attack and innocence. Who can combine the wholly incompatible,
and make a unity of what can never join? Walk you the gentle way, and
you will fear no evil and no shadows in the night. But place no terror
symbols on your path, or you will weave a crown of thorns from which
your brother and yourself will not escape. You cannot crucify yourself
alone. And if you are unfairly treated, he must suffer the unfairness
that you see. You cannot sacrifice yourself alone. For sacrifice is
total. If it could occur at all, it would entail the whole of Godâ€™s
creation, and the Father with the sacrifice of his beloved Son.

In your RELEASE from sacrifice is his made manifest, and shown to be his
own. But every pain you suffer do you see as proof that he is guilty of
attack. Thus would you make yourself to be the sign that he has lost his
innocence, and need but look on you to realize that he has been
condemned. And what to you has been unfair will come to him in
righteousness. The unjust vengeance that you suffer now belongs to him,
and when it rests on him are YOU set free. Wish not to make yourself a
living symbol of his guilt, for you will not escape the death you made
for him. But in his INNOCENCE you find your own.
