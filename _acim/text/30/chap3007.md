Would God have left the meaning of the world to your interpretation? If
He had, it HAS no meaning. For it cannot be that meaning changes
constantly, and yet is true. The Holy Spirit looks upon the world as
with one purpose, changelessly established. And no situation can affect
its aim, but must be in accord with it. For only if its aim could change
with every situation could each one be open to interpretation which is
different every time you think of it. You add an element into the script
you write for every minute in the day, and all that happens now means
something else. You take away another element, and every meaning shifts
accordingly.

What do your scripts reflect except your plans for what the day SHOULD
be? And thus you judge disaster and success, advance, retreat, and gain
and loss. These judgements all are made according to the roles the script
assigns. The fact they have no meaning in themselves is demonstrated by
the ease with which these labels change with other judgements, made on
different aspects of experience. And then, in looking back, you think
you see another meaning in what went before. What have you really done,
except to show there WAS no meaning there? But you assigned a meaning in
the light of goals that change, with every meaning shifting as they
change.

Only a constant purpose can endow events with stable meaning. But it
must accord ONE meaning to them all. If they are given different
meanings, it must be that they reflect but different purposes. And this
is all the meaning that they have. Can this BE meaning? Can confusion be
what meaning means? Perception cannot be in constant flux, and make
allowance for stability of meaning anywhere. Fear is a
judgement never justified. Its presence has no meaning but to show you
wrote a fearful script, and are afraid accordingly. But not because the
thing you fear has fearful meaning in itself.

A common PURPOSE is the only means whereby perception can be stabilized,
and one interpretation given to the world and all experiences here. In
this shared purpose is one judgement shared by everyone and everything
you see. You do not have to judge, for you have learned one meaning has
been given everything, and you are glad to see it everywhere. It cannot
change BECAUSE you would perceive it everywhere, unchanged by
circumstance. And so you OFFER it to all events, and let them offer you
stability.

Escape from judgement simply lies in this; all things have but one
purpose, which you share with all the world. And nothing in the world
can be opposed to it, for it belongs to everything as it belongs to you.
In single purpose is the end of all ideas of sacrifice, which must
assume a different purpose for the one who gains and him who loses. There
could be no thought of sacrifice apart from this idea. And it is this
idea of different goals which makes perception shift and meaning change.
In one united goal does this become impossible, for your agreement makes
interpretation stabilize and last.

How can communication really be established while the symbols which are
used mean different things? The Holy Spiritâ€™s goal gives one
interpretation, meaningful to you and to your brother. Thus can you
communicate with him, and he with you. In symbols which you both can
understand, the sacrifice of meaning is undone. All sacrifice entails
the loss of your ability to see relationships among events. And looked
at separately, they HAVE no meaning. For there is no light by which they
can be seen and understood. They have no purpose. And what they are for
cannot be seen. In any thought of loss, there IS no meaning. No-one has
agreed with you on what it means. It is a part of a distorted script,
which cannot be interpreted with meaning. It must be forever
unintelligible. This is not communication. Your dark dreams are but the
senseless, isolated scripts you write in sleep. Look not to separate
dreams for meaning. Only dreams of pardon can be shared. They mean the
same to both of you.

Do not interpret out of solitude, for what you see means nothing. It
will shift in what it stands for, and you will believe the
world is an uncertain place, in which you walk in danger and
uncertainty. It is but your INTERPRETATIONS which are lacking in
stability, for they are not in line with what you really are. This is a
state so seemingly unsafe that fear MUST rise. Do not continue thus, my
brothers. We have ONE Interpreter. And through His use of symbols are we
joined, so that they mean the same to all of us. Our common language
lets us speak to all our brothers, and to understand with them
forgiveness has been given to us all, and thus we can communicate again.
