The new beginning now becomes the focus of the curriculum. The
goal is clear, but now you need specific methods for attaining it. The
speed by which it can be reached depends on this one thing alone; your
willingness to practice every step. Each one will help a little every
time it is attempted. And together will these steps lead you from dreams
of judgement to forgiving dreams and out of pain and fear. They are not
new to you, but they are more ideas than rules of thought to you as yet.
So now we need to practice them awhile, until they are the rules by
which you live. We seek to make them habits now, so you will have them
ready for whatever need.
