Every mind which is split needs rehabilitation. The medical orientation
to rehabilitation emphasizes the body, while the vocational orientation
stresses the ego. The “team” approach generally leads more to confusion
than to anything else because it is too often misused as a way of
exerting the ego’s domination over other egos, rather than as a real
experiment in the cooperation of minds. Rehabilitation as a movement is
an improvement over the
overt neglect of those in need of help, but it is often little more than
a painful attempt on the part of the halt to lead the blind.

The ego is likely to fear broken bodies because it cannot tolerate them.
The ego cannot tolerate ego weakness either without ambivalence because
it is afraid of its own weakness as well as the weakness of its chosen
home. When it is threatened, the ego blocks your natural impulse to
help, placing you under the strain of divided will. You may then be
tempted to withdraw to allow your ego to recover and to gain enough
strength to be helpful again on a basis limited enough NOT to threaten
your ego, but too limited to give YOU joy. Those with broken bodies are
often looked down on by the ego because of its belief that nothing but a
perfect body is worthy as its OWN temple.

A mind that recoils from a hurt body is in great need of rehabilitation
itself. ALL symptoms of hurt need true helpfulness, and whenever they
are met with this, the mind that so meets them heals ITSELF.
Rehabilitation is an attitude of praising God as He Himself knows
praise. He offers praise to you, and you must offer it to others. The
chief handicaps of the clinicians lie in their attitudes to those whom
their egos perceive as weakened and damaged. BY these evaluations, they
have weakened and damaged their own helpfulness, and have thus set their
own rehabilitation back. Rehabilitation is NOT concerned either with the
ego’s fight for control, or its need to avoid and withdraw. You can do
much on behalf of your own rehabilitation AND that of others if, in a
situation calling for healing, you think of it this way:

> *“I am here ONLY to be truly helpful.*<br/>
> *I am here to represent Christ,Who sent me.*<br/>
> *I do NOT have to worry about what to say or what to do because He Who
> sent me will direct me.*<br/>
> *I am content to be wherever He wishes, knowing He goes there with
> me.<br/>
> I will be healed as I let Him teach me to heal.”*
