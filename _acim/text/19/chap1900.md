We said before that, when a situation has been dedicated wholly to
truth, peace is inevitable. Its attainment is the criterion by which the
wholeness of the dedication can be safely assumed. Yet we also said that
peace without faith will NEVER be attained, for what is wholly dedicated
to truth as its only goal is brought to truth BY faith. This faith
encompasses everyone involved, for only thus the situation is perceived
as meaningful and as a whole. And everyone must be involved in it, or
else your faith is limited, and your dedication incomplete.

Every situation, properly perceived, becomes an opportunity to heal the
Son of God. And he is healed BECAUSE you offered faith to him, giving
him to the Holy Spirit and releasing him from every demand your ego
would make of him. Thus do you see him free, and in this vision does the
Holy Spirit share. And since He shares it He has given it, and so He
heals through YOU. It is this joining Him in a united purpose which
makes this purpose real because you make it WHOLE. And this IS healing.
The body is healed, because you came without it and joined the Mind in
which all healing rests.
