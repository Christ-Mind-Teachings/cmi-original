The betrayal of the Son of God lies only in illusions, and all his
“sins” are but his own imagining. His reality is forever sinless. He
need not be forgiven but AWAKENED. In his dreams he HAS betrayed
himself, his brothers and his God. Yet what is done in dreams has not
been REALLY done. It is impossible to convince the dreamer that this is
so, for dreams are what they are BECAUSE of their illusion of reality.
Only in waking is the full release from them, for only then does it
become perfectly apparent that they had no effect on reality at all, and
did not change it. Fantasies CHANGE reality. That is their PURPOSE. They
cannot do so in reality, but they CAN do so in the mind that would have
reality different.

It is, then, only your wish to change reality that is fearful, because
by your wish you think you have ACCOMPLISHED what you wish. This strange
position, in a sense, acknowledges your power. Yet by distorting it, and
devoting it to “evil,” it also makes it unreal. You cannot be faithful
to two masters who ask of you conflicting things. What you use in
fantasy you DENY to truth. Yet what you GIVE to truth to use for you is
safe from fantasy.
