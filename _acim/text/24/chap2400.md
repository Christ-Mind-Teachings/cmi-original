Forget not that the motivation for this course is the attainment
and the keeping of the state of peace. Given this state the mind is
quiet, and the condition in which God is remembered is attained. It is
not necessary to tell Him what to do. He will not fail. Where He can
enter, there He is already. And can it be He cannot enter where He wills
to be? Peace will be yours BECAUSE it is His Will. Can you believe a
shadow can hold back the Will that holds the universe secure? God does
not wait upon illusions to let Him be Himself. No more His Son. They
ARE. And what illusion that idly seems to drift between them has the
power to defeat what is Their Will?

To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that
you hold. Not one can be kept hidden and obscure but it will jeopardize
your learning. No belief is neutral. Every one has the power to dictate
each decision you make. For a decision is a conclusion based on
everything that you believe. It is the OUTCOME of belief, and follows it
as surely as does suffering follow guilt and freedom sinlessness. There
IS no substitute for peace. What God creates HAS no alternative. The
truth arises from what He KNOWS. And your decisions come from your
beliefs as certainly as all creation rose in His Mind BECAUSE of what He
knows.
