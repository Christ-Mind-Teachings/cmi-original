This is Palm Sunday, the celebration of victory and the acceptance
of the truth. Let us not spend this holy week brooding on the
crucifixion of God’s Son, but happily in the celebration of his release.
For Easter is the sign of peace, not pain. A slain Christ has no
meaning. But a RISEN Christ becomes the symbol of the Son of God’s
forgiveness on himself; the sign he looks upon himself as healed and
whole.
