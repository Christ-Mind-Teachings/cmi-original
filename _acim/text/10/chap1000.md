Either God or the ego is insane. If you will examine the evidence
on both sides fairly, you will realize that this must be true. Neither
God nor the ego proposes a partial thought system. Each is internally
consistent, but they are diametrically opposed in all respects, so that
partial allegiance is impossible. Remember, too, that their results are
as different as their foundations, and their fundamentally
irreconcilable natures CANNOT be reconciled by your vacillations.
Nothing alive is fatherless, for life is creation. Therefore, your
decision is always an answer to the question, “Who is my father?” And
you will be faithful to the father you choose.

Yet what would you say to someone who really believed this question
involves conflict? If YOU made the ego, how can the ego have made you?
The authority problem remains the only source of perceived conflict,
because the ego was made out of the wish of God’s Son to father Him. The
ego, then, is nothing more than a delusional system, in which you made
your own father. Make no mistake about this. It sounds insane when it is
stated with perfect honesty, but the ego never looks upon what it does
with perfect honesty. Yet that IS its insane premise, which is carefully
hidden in the dark cornerstone of its thought system. And either the
ego, which you made, IS your father, or its whole thought system will
not stand.
