The Christ in you inhabits not a body. Yet He is in you. And thus
it must be that YOU are not within a body. What is within you cannot be
outside. And it is certain that you cannot be apart from what is at the
very center of your life. What gives you life cannot be housed in death.
No more can you. Christ is within a frame of holiness whose only purpose
is that He may be made manifest to those who know Him not, that He may
call to them to come to Him, and see Him where they thought their bodies
were. Then will their bodies melt away, that they may frame His holiness
in them.

No-one who carries Christ in him can fail to recognize Him everywhere.
EXCEPT in bodies. And as long as they believe they are in bodies, where
they think they are He cannot be. And so they carry Him unknowingly, and
do not make Him manifest. And thus they do not recognize Him where He
is. The son of man is not the risen Christ. Yet does the Son of God abide
exactly where he is, and walks with him within his holiness, as plain to
see as is his specialness set forth within his body.

The body NEEDS no healing. But the mind that thinks it IS a body is sick
indeed! And it is here that Christ sets forth the remedy. His purpose
folds the body in His light, and fills it with the holiness that shines
from Him. And nothing that the body says or does but makes Him
manifest. To those who know Him not it carries Him in gentleness and
love, to heal their minds. Such is the mission that your
brother has for you. And such it must be that your mission is for him.
