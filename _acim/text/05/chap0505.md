You must have noticed how often I have used your own ideas to help you.
You have learned to be a loving, wise and very understanding therapist
EXCEPT FOR YOURSELF. That exception has given you more than perception
for others because of what you saw in THEM,
but LESS than knowledge of your real relationships TO them because you
did not accept them as PART of you. Understanding IS beyond perception
because it introduces meaning. It is, however, below knowledge, even
though it can grow TOWARDS it. It is possible, with great effort, to
understand someone else to some extent and to be quite helpful to him,
but the effort is misdirected. The misdirection is quite apparent; it is
directed away from YOU.

This does not mean that it is LOST to you, but it DOES mean that you are
not aware of it. I have saved all your kindnesses and every loving
thought you have had. I have purified them of the errors which hid their
light, and have kept them for you in their own perfect radiance. They are
beyond destruction and beyond guilt. They came from the Holy Spirit
within YOU, and we know what God creates is eternal. What fear has
hidden still is part of you.

Joining the Atonement, which I have repeatedly asked you to do, is
always a way OUT of fear. This does not mean that you can safely fail to
acknowledge anything that is true. However, the Holy Spirit will not
fail to help you re-interpret everything that you perceive as fearful,
and teach you that ONLY what is loving IS true. Truth is beyond your
ability to destroy, but entirely within your grasp. It belongs to you
because you created it. It is yours because it is a part of you, just as
you are part of God because He created YOU.

The Atonement is the GUARANTEE of the safety of the Kingdom. Nothing
good is lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice for
creation. Nothing that is NOT good was ever created. And therefore
CANNOT be protected. What the ego makes it KEEPS TO ITSELF, and so it is
without strength. Its unshared existence does not die; it was merely
never born. Real birth is not a beginning; it is a CONTINUING.
Everything that can continue has BEEN born, but it can INCREASE as you
are willing to return the part of your mind that needs healing to the
higher part, and thus render your creating undivided.

As a therapist, you yourself tell your patients that the real difference
between neurotic and “healthy” guilt feelings is that neurotic guilt
feelings DO NOT HELP ANYONE. This distinction is wise though incomplete.
Let us make the distinction a little sharper now. Neurotic guilt
feelings are a device of the ego for “atoning”
without sharing, and for asking pardon without change. The ego NEVER
calls for REAL Atonement, and cannot tolerate forgiveness, which IS
change.

Your concept of “healthy guilt feelings” has merit, but without the
concept of the Atonement it lacks the healing potential it holds. You
made the distinction in terms of feelings which led to a decision not to
REPEAT the error, which is only PART of healing. Your concept lacked the
idea of UNDOING it. What you were really advocating, then, was adopting
a policy of sharing without a real FOUNDATION. I have come to GIVE you
the foundation, so your own thoughts can make you REALLY free. You have
carried the burden of the ideas you did not share and which were
therefore too weak to increase, but you did not recognize how to undo
their existence BECAUSE you had made them.

You CANNOT cancel out your past errors alone. They will NOT disappear
from your mind without remedy. The remedy is NOT of your making, any
more than YOU are. The Atonement cannot be understood except as a PURE
ACT OF SHARING. That is what is meant when we said it is possible, even
in this world, to listen to ONE voice. If you are part of God and the
Sonship is one, you CANNOT be limited to the “self ” the ego sees. Every
loving thought held in ANY part of the Sonship belongs to every part. It
is shared BECAUSE it is loving. Sharing is God’s way of creating, and
also YOURS. Your ego can keep you in exile FROM the Kingdom, but in the
Kingdom itself it has no power.

You have become willing to receive my messages as I give them without
interference by the ego, so we can clarify an earlier point. We said
that you will one day teach as much as you learn, and that will keep you
in balance. The time is now because you have LET it be now. You cannot
learn EXCEPT by teaching. I heard one voice because I had learned that
learning is attained BY teaching. I understood that I COULD NOT ATONE
FOR MYSELF ALONE.

Listening to one voice means the will to SHARE the voice in order to
hear it yourself. The mind that was in me is still irresistibly drawn to
every mind created by God because God’s Wholeness IS the wholeness of
His Son.

Turning the other cheek does NOT mean that you should
submit to violence without protest. It means that you cannot BE hurt,
and do not want to show your brother anything EXCEPT your wholeness.
Show him that he CANNOT hurt you and hold nothing against him, or you
hold it against yourself. Teaching is done in many ways, – by formal
means, by guidance, and above all BY EXAMPLE. Teaching is therapy
because it means the SHARING of ideas, and the awareness that to share
them is to STRENGTHEN them. The union of the Sonship IS its protection.
The ego cannot prevail against the Kingdom BECAUSE it is united, and the
ego fades away and is undone in the presence of the attraction of the
parts of the Sonship which hear the call of the Holy Spirit to be as
One.

I cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned, which arose in me
BECAUSE I learned it. I call upon you to teach what you have learned
because, by so doing, YOU can depend on it. Make it dependable in my
name because my name is the name of God’s Son. What I learned I give you
freely, and the mind which was in me rejoices as YOU choose to hear
it. The Holy Spirit atones in all of us by UNDOING, and thus lifts the
burden you have placed in your mind. By following Him, He leads you back
to God where you belong, and how can you find this way except by taking
your brother with you?

My part in the Atonement is not complete until YOU join it and give it
away. As you teach, so shall you learn. I will never leave you or
forsake you, because to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God
who created me. You will forsake yourselves and God if you forsake ANY
of your brothers. You are more than your brother’s keeper. In fact, you
do not WANT to keep him. You must learn to see him as he is, and KNOW
that he belongs to God as you do. How could you treat your brother
better than by rendering unto God the things which are God’s?

Ideas do not LEAVE the mind which thought them to have a separate being,
nor do separate thoughts conflict with one another in space because they
do not occupy space at all. However, human ideas CAN conflict in content
because they occur at different levels, and include opposite thoughts at
the SAME level. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SHARE OPPOSING THOUGHTS. The Holy
Spirit does not LET you forsake your brothers. Therefore, you can really
share ONLY the
parts of your thoughts which are of Him, and which He also keeps for
YOU. And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. All the rest remains with you
until He has re-interpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making
them, too, worthy of being shared. When they have been sufficiently
purified He lets you give them away. The will to share them IS their
purification.

The Atonement gives you the power of a healed mind, but the power to
create is of God. Therefore, those who have been forgiven must devote
themselves first to healing because, having RECEIVED the idea of
healing, they must GIVE it to HOLD it. The full power of creation cannot
be expressed as long as ANY of God’s ideas withhold it from the Kingdom.
The joint will of ALL the Sonship is the only creator that can create
like the Father, because only the complete can think completely, and the
thinking of God lacks nothing. Everything you think that is not through
the Holy Spirit IS lacking.

How can you who are so holy suffer? All your past, except its beauty, is
gone, and nothing is left except a blessing. You can indeed depart in
peace because I have loved you as I loved myself. You go WITH my
blessing and FOR my blessing. Hold it and share it, that it may always
be ours. I place the peace of God in your heart and in your hands, to
hold and share. The heart is pure to hold it and the hands are strong to
give it. We cannot lose. My judgement is as strong as the wisdom of God,
in Whose Heart and Hands we have our being. His quiet children are His
blessed Sons. The Thoughts of God are with you.
