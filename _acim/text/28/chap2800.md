The miracle does nothing. All it does is to UNDO. And thus it
cancels out the interference to what has been done. It does not add, but
merely takes away. And what it takes away is long since gone, but being
kept in memory, appears to have immediate effects. This world was over
long ago. The thoughts that made it are no longer in the mind that
thought of them and loved them for a little while. The miracle but shows
the past is gone, and what has truly gone has no effects. Remembering a
cause can but produce illusions of its presence, not effects.

All the effects of guilt are here no more. For guilt is over. In its
passing went its consequences, left without a cause. Why would you cling
to it in memory if you did not DESIRE its effects? Remembering is as
selective as perception, being its past tense. It is perception of the
past as if it were occurring now and still were there to see. Memory,
like perception, is a skill made up by you, to take the place of what
God gave in your creation. And like all the things you made, it can be
used to serve another purpose, and to be the means for something else.
It can be used to heal and not to hurt, if you so wish it be.

Nothing employed for healing represents an effort to do anything at all.
It is a recognition that you have no needs which mean that something
must be done. It is an unselective memory, which is not used to
interfere with truth. All things the Holy Spirit can
employ for healing have been given Him, without the content and the
purposes for which they have been made. They are but skills without an
application. They AWAIT their use. They have no dedication and no aim.
