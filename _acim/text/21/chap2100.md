Projection makes perception. The world you see is what you gave it,
nothing more than that. But though it is no more than that, it is not
less. Therefore, to you it is important. It is the witness to your state
of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition. As a man thinketh,
so does he perceive. Therefore, seek not to change the world, but will to
change your mind ABOUT the world. Perception is a RESULT, not a cause.
And that is why order of difficulty in miracles is meaningless.
Everything looked upon with vision is healed and holy. Nothing perceived
without it means anything. And where there is no meaning, there is
chaos.

Damnation is your judgement on yourself, and this you WILL project upon
the world. See it as damned, and all you see is what you did to hurt the
Son of God. If you behold disaster and catastrophe, you tried to crucify
him. If you see holiness and hope, you joined the Will of God to set him
free. There is no choice that lies between these two decisions. And you
WILL see the witness to the choice you made, and learn from this to
RECOGNIZE which one you chose.
