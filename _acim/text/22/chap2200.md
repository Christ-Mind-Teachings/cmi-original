Take pity on yourselves, so long enslaved. Rejoice whom God hath
joined have come together, and need no longer look on sin apart. No two
can look on sin together, for they could never see it in the same place
and time. Sin is a strictly individual perception, seen in the other,
yet believed by each to be within himself. And each one seems to make a
different error, and one the other cannot understand. Brothers, it IS
the same, made by the same, and forgiven for its maker in the same way.

The holiness of your relationship forgives you both, undoing the effects
of what you both believed and saw. And with their going is the NEED for
sin gone with them. Who has need for sin? Only the lonely and alone, who
see their brothers different from themselves. It is this difference,
seen but not real, that makes the need for sin, not real but seen, seem
justified. And all this would be real, if sin were so. For an unholy
relationship is based on differences, where each one thinks the other
has what he has not. They come together, each to complete himself and
rob the other. They stay until they think there’s nothing left to steal,
and then move on. And so they wander through a world of strangers,
unlike themselves, living with their bodies perhaps under a common roof
that shelters neither; in the same
room and yet a world apart.

A holy relationship starts from a different premise. Each one has looked
within and seen no lack. Accepting his completion, he would extend it by
joining with another, whole as himself. He sees no difference between
these selves, for differences are only of the body. Therefore, he looks
on nothing he would take. He denies not his own reality BECAUSE it is
the truth. Just under Heaven does he stand, but close enough not to
return to earth. For this relationship has Heaven’s holiness. How far
from home can a relationship so like to Heaven be?

Think what a holy relationship can teach! Here is belief in differences
undone. Here is the faith in differences shifted to sameness. And reason
now can lead you to the logical conclusion of your union. It must
extend, as you extended when you joined. It must reach out beyond
itself, as you reached out beyond the body to LET yourselves be joined.
And now the sameness which you saw extends, and finally removes all
sense of differences, so that the sameness that lies beneath them all
becomes apparent. Here is the golden circle where you recognize the Son
of God. For what is born into a holy relationship can NEVER end.
