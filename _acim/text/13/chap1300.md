All therapy is release from the past. That is why the Holy Spirit is the
only therapist. He teaches that the past does not exist, a fact which
belongs to the sphere of knowledge, and which therefore no-one in the
world knows. It would indeed be impossible to BE in the world with this
knowledge. For the mind that knows this unequivocally knows also that it
dwells in eternity, and utilizes no perception at all. It therefore does
not consider where it is, because the concept “where” does not mean
anything to it. It knows that it is EVERYWHERE, just as it HAS
EVERYTHING, and FOREVER.

The very real difference between perception and knowledge becomes quite
apparent if you consider this: There is nothing partial about knowledge.
Every aspect is whole, and therefore no aspect is separate. YOU are an
aspect of knowledge, being in the Mind of God,Who KNOWS you. All
knowledge must be yours, for in you IS all knowledge.  Perception, at
its loftiest, is never complete. Even the perception of the Holy Spirit,
as perfect as perception can be, is without meaning in Heaven.
Perception can reach everywhere under His guidance, for the vision of
Christ beholds everything in light. Yet no perception, however holy, will
last forever.
