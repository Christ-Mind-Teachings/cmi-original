You have been told not to make error real, and the way to do this
is very simple. If you WANT to believe in error, you would HAVE to make
it real, because it is not true. But truth is real in its own right, and
to believe in truth, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

Understand that you do not respond to stimuli, but to stimuli AS YOU
INTERPRET THEM. Your interpretation thus becomes the justification for
the response. That is why analyzing the motives of others is hazardous
to YOU. If you decide that someone is really trying to attack you or
desert you or enslave you, you will respond AS IF he had actually done
so, because you have made his error REAL to you. To interpret error is
to give it power, and having done this, you WILL overlook truth.

The analysis of ego-motivation is very complicated, very obscuring, and
NEVER without the risk of your own ego-involvement. The whole process
represents a clearcut attempt to demonstrate your OWN ability to
understand what you perceive. This is shown by the fact that you react
to your interpretations AS IF they were correct, and control your
reactions behaviorally, but not emotionally. This is quite evidently a
mental split, in which you have attacked the integrity of your mind, and
pitted one level within it against another.
