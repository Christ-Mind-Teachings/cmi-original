You believe that “being afraid” is involuntary; something beyond your
control. Yet I have told you several times that only CONSTRUCTIVE acts
should be involuntary. We have said that Christ-control can take over
everything that does NOT matter, while Christ-guidance can direct
everything that DOES, if you so choose. Fear cannot be
Christ-controlled, but it CAN be self-controlled. It PREVENTS me from
controlling it. The correction is therefore a matter of YOUR will,
because its presence shows that you have raised the UNIMPORTANT to a
higher level than it warrants. You have thus brought it under YOUR will,
where it does not belong. This means that YOU feel responsible for
it. The level confusion here is obvious.

The reason I cannot control fear for you is that you are attempting to
raise to the mind level the proper content of lower-order reality. I do
not foster level confusion, but YOU can choose to correct it. You would
not tolerate insane BEHAVIOR on your part, and would hardly advance the
excuse that you could not help it. Why should you tolerate insane
THINKING? There is a confusion here
which you would do well to look at clearly. YOU believe that you are
responsible for what you DO, but NOT for what you THINK. The truth is
that you ARE responsible for what you think because it is only at this
level that you CAN exercise choice.

What you do COMES FROM what you think. You cannot separate yourself from
the truth by “giving” autonomy to behavior. This is controlled by me
automatically, as soon as you place what you think under my guidance.
Whenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your
mind to miscreate, or have NOT allowed me to guide it. It is pointless
to believe that controlling the OUTCOME of mis-thought can result in
healing. When you are fearful you have willed wrongly. This is why you
feel responsible for it. You must change your MIND, not your behavior,
and this IS a matter of will.

You do not need guidance EXCEPT at the mind level. Correction belongs
ONLY at the level where creation is possible. The term does not mean
anything at the symptom level, where it cannot work. The correction of
fear IS your responsibility. When you ask for release from fear, you are
implying that it is not. You should ask, instead, for help in the
conditions which have brought the fear about. These conditions ALWAYS
entail a separated mind willingness. At that level, you CAN help it. You
are much too tolerant of mind wandering, thus passively condoning its
miscreations. The particular result does not matter, but the fundamental
error DOES. The correction is always the same. Before you will to do
anything, ask me if your will is in accord with mine. If you are sure
that it is, there will BE no fear.

Fear is always a sign of strain, which arises whenever the WILL to do
conflicts with WHAT you do. This situation arises in two ways;

1.  You can will to do conflicting things, either simultaneously or
    successively. This produces conflicted behavior, which is
    intolerable to yourself because the part of the will that wants to
    do something ELSE is outraged.

2.  You can BEHAVE as you think you should, but without entirely WILLING
    to do so. This produces consistent behavior, but entails great
    strain WITHIN the self. In both cases, the will and the behavior
    are out of accord, resulting in a situation in which
    you are doing what you do NOT will. This arouses a sense of coercion,
    which usually produces rage. The rage then invades the mind, and
    projection in the wrong sense is likely to follow. Depression or
    anxiety is virtually certain.

Remember that whenever there is fear, it is because you have NOT MADE
UP YOUR MIND. Your will is split, and your behavior inevitably becomes
erratic. Correcting at the behavioral level can shift the error from
the first to the second type of strain described above, but will NOT
obliterate the fear. It is possible to reach a state in which you
bring your will under my guidance without much conscious effort, but
this implies habit patterns which you have not developed dependably as
yet. God cannot ask MORE than you will. The strength to DO comes from
your own undivided WILL to do. There is NO strain in doing God’s Will
as soon as you recognize that it is also your OWN.

The lesson here is quite simple, but particularly apt to be
overlooked. I will therefore repeat it, urging you to listen. Only
your MIND can produce fear. It does so whenever it is conflicted in
what it wills, thus producing inevitable strain because willing and
doing become discordant. This cannot be corrected by better DOING, but
it CAN be corrected by higher WILLING.
