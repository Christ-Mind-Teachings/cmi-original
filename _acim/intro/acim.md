# A Course in Miracles - Sparkly Edition

Many have found the “Sparkly” version of A Course In Miracles to have an
aliveness about it. People ask, what is the difference between this
version and the others? It has an energy about it. The words speak
clearly and the tone is friendly.

The major differences come in the first 8 chapters especially the
Principles Of Miracles. This version was put together through the
guidance and assurance received by 5 individuals and was based on all
the material provided through the process of discovery and Jesus’
direction. This is the original edit that Helen and Bill were guided to
complete and place on deposit in the Edgar Cayce Library , before the
later edits made in the popular Foundation of Inner Peace version or
“FIP”.

[*The Sparkly Edition of A Course in Miracles* Text](/acim/intro/text/) is available here.

The Workbook and Manual for Teachers will be added to the Library -
eventually!

You can learn more about the Sparkly Edition at [ACIM Search](http://acimsearch.org/).
