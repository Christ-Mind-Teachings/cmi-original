# christmind.info: Christ Mind Teachings

## Introduction

Christmind.info is a library for learning and sharing inspiration from 
contemporary teachings of Christ, of which there are many.

First, what is Christ? Here are a few hints from Raj[^1].

Christ is:
-   that which is experiencing God
-   the pure, innocent, direct expression of God
-   that which lives within you, in the quiet present






[^1]: Raj is channeled by Paul Tuttle at the Northwest Foundation 
for *A Course in Miracles*.
