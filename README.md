# Christ Mind Teachings

## Introduction

Christmind.info is a library for learning and sharing inspiration from 
contemporary teachings of Christ, of which there are many.

The Library initially contains the teachings from the *Way of Mastery*
and from the *Northwest Foundation for ACIM*.

The main goal of the project is to provide a repository of Christ Mind
teachings that is uncluttered and easily accessible.
