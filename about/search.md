[Return to Search Page](/search/)

You can search through all *indexed pages* for a word or phrase. The
search is specific to the *search source* selected in the drop down.

Searches are case insensitive and ignore punctuation to increase the
likelihood of finding a match. Searches will find matches that begin on
a word boundary so searching for the term "day" will find "day" and
"days" but will not match "today".

Search results persist until replaced by a new search. This means you
can leave the *Search* page and find the search results still available
when you return.

The number of matches found by a search is displayed when the search
returns. When no matches are found the previous search results remain
available. The number of matches reported is actually the number of
paragraphs that contain one or more matches so it is possible that the
number of actual matches is greater than the number reported.

### Search Sources

A search is limited to the selected source, either the ACIM Sparkly
Edition, the *Way of Mastery* or *Northwest Foundation for ACIM*. It is
not possible to search across sources with a single search.

Before performing a search make sure the desired source is selected.

### Indexed Pages

Library contents must be indexed before being searchable and not all
materials are currently indexed. A page cannot be indexed before it is
fully formatted. Only the *Northwest Foundation for ACIM* study
group materials are not fully indexed.

These tables show what is indexed and what is not.
